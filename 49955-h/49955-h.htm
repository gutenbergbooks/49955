<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Few countries have been more strangely misunderstood
by the average Englishman than Bohemia
has been. The mischievous blunder of some fifteenth
century Frenchman, who confused the gipsies who
had just arrived in France with the nation which was
just then startling Europe by its resistance to the
forces of the Empire, has left a deeper mark on the
imagination of most of our countrymen than the
martyrdom of Hus or even the sufferings of our own
Princess Elizabeth. The word “Bohemian” has
passed into newspaper slang; and it has been so
often quoted in its slang sense by people who ought
to be more careful in their language, that it has
really hindered the study of the real country which
it misrepresents. The few who care to hear anything
more of a people so strangely slandered, have often
been yet further blinded by their readiness to accept
as absolute truth the prejudices of the German and
Magyar opponents of the Bohemian national feeling.
From these sources they have derived an impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
of a set of narrow Ultramontanes, who, oddly enough,
combine their religious bigotries in favour of Roman
Catholicism with a reliance on Russia in political
affairs. These prejudices ought certainly to yield
to an acquaintance with the people in their own
country. A Roman Catholicism, tempered by an
enthusiasm for Hus and Z̆iz̆ka and King George,
can scarcely be a very obscurantist form of creed;
and an intense feeling of national distinctness can
hardly be compatible with an anxiety to be absorbed
by the great North-eastern Empire, though undoubtedly
it produces a stronger repulsion against
the equally denationalising force of Pan-Germanism.
Perhaps a careful study of the history of a country
so much misunderstood will be the best preparation
for a fairer appreciation of its present difficulties.</p>

<p>I have now to thank the many kind friends who
have helped me in my work. Of these the chief
helper has been Professor Mourek. During the whole
of my stay at Prague I received every assistance from
him which a foreigner studying in that town could
possibly require; and since I have returned to England
he has helped me most energetically in procuring
various illustrations necessary for my book. I have
also to thank Count Leo Thun (the cousin of the
late Governor of Bohemia) for many useful hints
and introductions. I should also thank Mr. Custos
Borovsky, of the Rudolfinum, for the kindness with
which he supplied me with introductions during my
visits to other towns in Bohemia and Moravia. I
should also thank Professor Rez̆ek for many useful
hints, especially about the difficult reign of Ferdinand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
I. Professor Kalausek I have to thank for hints
about the earlier period. Professor Tomek I must
thank for allowing me to use the map of Prague
which appears in my book. I must also thank Dr.
Toman for the use of the curious pictures of Z̆iz̆ka.
For help in my work in other towns I must thank
Father Wurm, of Olmütz (Olomouci); Mr. Palliardi,
of Znaym (Znojem); Professor Brettholz, of Brünn
(Brno); the Sub-librarian of C̆aslau; Professor Lemminger,
of Kuttenberg (Kutna Hora); Mr. Gross, of
Krumov; Father Fuc̆ik, of Prachatice; Professor
Strnad, of Pilsen (Plz̆en); Monsignore Rodler, of
Budweis (Budejóvice); the Keeper of the Archives
at Wittingau (Tr̆ebon̆), and Professor Sedlac̆ek, of
Tabor. I also wish to thank Mr. C̆elakovsky, of the
Town Archives of Prague, for the suggestion about
the relation of the early Utraquist rising to the
differences between Bohemian workmen and German
employers (see <a href="#Page_231">Chap. ix. pp. 231, 232</a>).</p>

<p>The question of when and how far to use the
Bohemian names of places is one of some difficulty.
My own instinct would be to use them wherever
possible. But it cannot be denied that there are
cases in which the German forms are so well known
to English readers, and some in which the Bohemian
names seem so unpronounceable, that it would be
affectation to follow the strict rules of national
expression. Praha, of course, has been hopelessly
Anglicized into Prague; and Olomouci, Cheb, Brno,
and Plz̆en have been as certainly Germanised into
Olmütz, Eger, Brünn, and Pilsen. Even in these
cases I have on some occasions added the Bohemian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
names in brackets. But it was so difficult to know
what names of Bohemian towns are generally known
in England, that I may sometimes seem to have been
inconsistent in my practice. Only let me assure my
readers that my wish has been to impress on them
the distinctive character of the Bohemian language,
and at the same time to secure the recognition of any
places with whose names they are already familiar.</p>

<h1>THE STORY OF BOHEMIA.</h1>

<h2>I.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE EARLIEST PERIOD OF BOHEMIAN
HISTORY TO THE HUNGARIAN INVASION.<br />
(-885.)</span></h2>

<p>The history of a lost nationality is necessarily
tragic and can rarely be commonplace. In the
case of Bohemia the interest is increased by the
variety of the parts which she was forced to play,
each of which, while of great value to the world,
assisted in some degree to hasten her ruin. Thus,
for instance, the intense desire to maintain her own
independent life brought her into collision with neighbouring
States which were determined to crush or
to absorb her; while, on the other hand, her position
as the champion of a race, of which she was but one
member, dragged her into further quarrels that were
not necessarily the result of her geographical position.
And, lastly, the very desire to maintain her national
existence, and to defend the freedom of her Slavonic
kinsmen, constantly compelled her to mix in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
quarrels of that larger world with which she and they
had so little sympathy; and even to accept a share
in the responsibilities of that Empire, which, calling
itself Roman, was always becoming more and more
Teutonic, and therefore more anti-Slavonic.</p>

<p>And in that struggle between Teuton and Slav the
one thing which, from the earliest to the latest times,
has been the most prized treasure, and the subject
of the fiercest championship of the Bohemian, is
his language. Every effort for constitutional government
and national liberty has always directly
connected itself with this aspiration for the preservation,
development, and general recognition of this
great right. Sigismund, in the time of his most cruel
attempts to crush out the freedom of his subjects, was
denounced as “the enemy of our language,” rather
than of our nation. Hus is honoured, even by
Roman Catholic Bohemians, as the assertor and
developer of their language. It was the great crime
of Joseph II. that he desired to destroy it. If we
could have talked with a Bohemian Christian of the
ninth or tenth century, we should have found his
deepest feelings stirred by a reference to the language
which was then assuming its first shape; and the
same subject has the deepest interest for the Bohemian
patriot of the nineteenth century, now that his language
has become one of the most varied and expressive
of modern Europe.</p>

<p>Nor must we forget the connection of the ecclesiastical
independence of Bohemia with her most vivid
political life. From the time when the mission of
Cyril and Methodius brought to the front the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of a Slavonic ritual, and of an ecclesiastical organisation,
which was to be separated as far as possible
from Teutonic influences, to the time when Bohemia
sank before Ferdinand in the struggle between
national Protestantism and Imperial Romanism, the
questions of Bohemian language and Bohemian self-government
were mixed up continually with the claim
to be guided in spiritual things by a clergy who
preached and prayed in the Slavonic language.</p>

<p>Even the earliest traditions show that long before
the introduction of Christianity the Bohemian ideal
of national life had been totally different from that of
the surrounding nations. The poem of “The Judgment
of Libus̆a,” which seems to embody the earliest
picture of Bohemian life, is no Iliad or Niebelungen
Lied, no story of robber dens or rapes of the Sabines,
but the representation of a peace-loving nation trying
to uphold traditions of communal ownership of land,
and the gentle guidance of the wisest in judicial
affairs, modified by an organised expression of popular
opinion.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>So great an impression did the poems, in which
this ideal is set forth, produce on the Bohemian mind,
that extracts from them are translated at full length
by the chronicler Cosmas, who took an active part in
the bustling politics of the eleventh century, when
these ideals must have seemed to belong to a very
distant past.</p>

<p>According to this writer, certain people who had
been scattered by the failure of the Tower of Babel,
wandered into Germany where they found various
wild beasts. One party in the course of their wanderings
found a plain lying near the mountain Rip, and
between the rivers Ogra (Eger), and Wlitawa
(Moldau). This plain they called Bohemia after
the eldest of the party named Boemus. Here they
founded a peaceable and communistic settlement
where they desired to make war on none but the
beasts. But, some ambitious men having introduced
the evil of private property, it became necessary to
choose a judge to decide the disputes which now
unavoidably arose. So they chose as their judge
their best man named Crocco, who founded a camp.
He had three daughters, of whom the eldest was
skilled in medicine, the second was a kind of religious
teacher, who instructed the people in the worship of
Oreads and Dryads; while the third, Libus̆a, was
distinguished for her political wisdom and foresight,
and was supposed to be an inspired prophetess.</p>

<p>Libus̆a was accordingly chosen to the judicial
office on her father’s death. But Crocco’s formation
of a camp seems to have stirred the military spirit in
the Bohemians; and the story which follows clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
indicates the transition from the earlier and more
peaceable stage to the later developments of national
organisation. Two powerful chiefs are disputing for
the land, which has come to them from their father.
The question is submitted to Libus̆a, as the chief
judge. On the day of the trial she appears in great
state, summons before her the heads of the different
families or tribes, and submits to them her proposals
for settling this question. She declares that,
according to the old custom of their people, the
land ought either to be equally divided between the
brothers, or else they ought to share it in common.
The leaders of the tribes, after collecting in some way
the votes of the assembly, decide that the land is to
be held in common, basing their judgment also on the
old traditions of the nation. Thereupon the elder of
the disputants rises in anger, and declares that he
ought to have retained the land in right of primogeniture,
and further that the Bohemians ought not
to submit any longer to women, who were fitter for
receiving the advances of wooers than of dictating
laws to soldiers.</p>

<p>Then follows a scene which seems at once to fix
the point of change arrived at, and to make the
circumstances more familiar for ordinary readers by
the parallel which it suggests with a familiar transition
to military kingship recorded in the Second Book of
Samuel.</p>

<p>Libus̆a, anxious to warn her people of the full
effect of the course they are taking, sets forth to them
the dangers of a military monarchy. Beginning with
a reference to the story of the petition of the frogs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Jupiter, she reminds them that it will be more easy to
choose a chief than to remove him. “Before him
your knees will tremble, and your tongue cleave to
your mouth. You will with difficulty answer, ‘Yes,
sir! yes, sir!’ He will condemn men by his nod
without your judgment being taken; he will cut off
the head of one, and throw others into prison; some
of you he will make slaves, and others exactors and
torturers; others, again, he will make cooks or bakers
or millers. He will appoint you as tribunes or centurions
or cultivators of his vines and wheat, as
armourers and preparers of skins. He will reduce
your sons and daughters to subjection, and will carry
off the best of your horses and mares and cattle to
his palace. He will take what is best from your fields
and plains and meadows and vineyards, and turn
them to his own use.” But though the criminal folly
of the change proposed is indicated as clearly by
Libus̆a as by Samuel, yet in both stories we find by
a strange contradiction the same half-mystical enthusiasm
for the person of the first king.</p>

<p>Libus̆a, unable to resist the popular demand that
she should take a husband and give the Bohemians a
king, tells the people to go to a certain village where
they will find a man ploughing with oxen. Him
they are to greet as their king, and his posterity will
rule in this land for ever. The messengers plead that
they do not know the way to the village. Libus̆a
answers that if they will follow her horse it will guide
them. They obey; and they at last arrive at the
village of Stadic, where they find Pr̆emysl ploughing.
They call on him to change his dress and mount the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
horse, as Queen Libus̆a and all the people demand
him as their ruler. Pr̆emysl therefore sets free his
oxen, telling them to go whence they came, and
strikes his goad into the ground. The oxen vanish
from sight, and the goad puts forth leaves and fruits.
Then Pr̆emysl comes with the messengers; but he insists
on taking with him his ploughman’s boots, that
his successors may be made humble and merciful by
the memory of the state from whence they sprung;
“and these boots,” says Cosmas (writing in the eleventh
century), “are preserved at Vys̆ehrad to this day in
the Duke’s chamber.”</p>

<p>There is another legend which still more quaintly
marks this transition from mild and readily accepted
rule to the era of physical force. According to this
story the maidens of Bohemia founded a city which
they called Dĕvín from Devina, “a maiden.” The
young men to maintain their independence set up an
opposition town called Hrasten. The intercourse
between these rival towns seems to have been sometimes
friendly and sometimes hostile; but always
apparently on equal terms as long as Libus̆a lived.
After her death, however, the men won the day, and
ever afterwards held the women under their control.</p>

<p>But the golden age of Queen Libus̆a is long past,
when we catch sight of the Bohemians in even the
earliest period of authentic history. First we have
a dim vision of a great Slavonic Empire stretching
northwards to the Spree, and eastwards to the
Carpathians; of struggles with Avars and Huns, and,
above all, with the Franks. Then suddenly, as the
dim mist clears a little, we find that the Franks have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
become Christian, and the great struggle between
German and Slav, hinted at already in the poem of
“Libus̆a’s Judgment,” has begun in earnest. The
centre of resistance to the German, however, is not in
Bohemia, but in the neighbouring Slavonic dukedom
of Moravia; and it gathers round a prince named
Rostislav, who is encouraging both Moravians and
Bohemians to stand firm against those peculiar ideas
of Christianity, which Charles the Great and his
descendants tried to thrust upon reluctant nations by
fire and sword. Some Bohemians had indeed been
compelled by Louis, the grandson of Charles the
Great, to accept baptism; and Christian Bohemia
owned the authority of the German Archbishop of
Regensburg.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>But the Duke of Bohemia, encouraged by Rostislav,
still held out against the Carlovingian form of
Christianity; the Moravians defeated Louis in 849,
and Rostislav strengthened his own position as the
champion of Slavonic independence by an alliance
with the Bulgarians. This alliance was to produce
results very unexpected at the time by Rostislav, and
powerfully affecting the future of Moravia and Bohemia.
Boris, the powerful king of Bulgaria, had
received at his Court a Christian monk named Methodius,
the son of a patrician of Thessalonica. Apparently
Methodius had originally been brought to the
Bulgarian Court on account of his artistic talent; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
he was also a very zealous Christian; and when Boris
ordered him to paint such a picture, in the hall of
his palace, as would strike terror into all who saw
it, Methodius improved the occasion by painting a
picture of the Last Judgment. The inquiries and
explanations that followed prepared the way for the
acceptance of the new faith by the king of Bulgaria
and his subjects.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<a name="i_037" id="i_037"></a>

<img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="400" height="283" alt="" />

<p class="caption">LIBUS̆A’S BATH JUST BELOW THE VYS̆EHRAD.</p>

</div>

<p>But the Greek missionaries found that the want of
a written language prevented them from giving their
Slavonic converts full instruction in the details of the
Christian creed. Methodius, therefore, called in the
help of his brother Cyril, who had been occupied in
the conversion of the Chazars, a people whose country
lay a little to the north of the Bulgarian kingdom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Cyril was a learned monk, who had been trained at
the Court of Constantinople, and was well skilled in
various languages. Taking the Greek alphabet as
his basis, but altering its form, he invented a written
language for the Slavonic race, into which he translated
a liturgy, several books of the Bible, and some
of the early Fathers.</p>

<p>The news of the conversion of the Bulgarians
quickly came to the ears of Rostislav, for the great
Bulgarian kingdom touched the eastern side of
Moravia; and the recent alliance had brought the
two peoples into closer intercourse. Unwelcome as
Christianity had seemed to the Moravians, when presented
to them as a demand of Frankish invaders,
and taught in an unknown tongue, its lessons came
with a very different force when urged by pious and
peaceable monks, recommended by friendly kinsmen,
and expounded in a language intelligible to the
converts. Rostislav no doubt quickly perceived that
the new teaching might form a valuable link in the
alliance of the Slavs against their enemies. He
appealed to the Emperor of the East to send Cyril
and Methodius to Moravia; and, when they arrived at
the town of Devina, Rostislav and his followers went
out to welcome them; and after Cyril had retired
from the mission, Methodius was recognised by the
Pope as Archbishop of Moravia and Pannonia.</p>

<p>But troubles very soon began for the new-comers.
The German party in Moravia were resentful at the
introduction into the churches of what they considered
a barbarous language; and they saw danger
to their power, both in the adoption of a ritual which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
was understood by the people, and in the assertion of
an episcopal authority which claimed to be independent
of the German bishops. Nor was it only by
foreigners that the influence of Cyril and Methodius
was endangered; an opposition was roused even among
the Moravians themselves. Svatopluk, the nephew and
rival of Rostislav, seems to have accepted some kind
of nominal Christianity, but unaccompanied by any
change of life, or even by any great reverence for the
externals of worship; and he opposed the new apostles
of the Slavs with the greatest fierceness. The opposition
of this ambitious prince no doubt arose at first from
his desire to pose as the champion of the German
party, who were undermining his uncle’s authority.
According to one story he had already attempted to
poison Rostislav, and having failed in that purpose he
conspired with the Emperor Louis against him, made
him prisoner, and sent him off to the Imperial Court to
be tried. Louis threw Rostislav into prison, and put
out his eyes. But Svatopluk, though he succeeded
in seizing the Dukedom, did not long retain the confidence
of the Emperor or the German party. He, in
his turn, was deposed and thrown into prison.</p>

<p>Then the Moravians rose against the Franks, under
a man named Slavomir, who, according to one story,
was a pupil of Methodius. The Emperor thereupon
set Svatopluk free, and sent him at the head of an
army to suppress the new rising. Svatopluk betrayed
his soldiers to his countrymen, destroyed the German
army, and once more became Duke of Moravia. He
now felt it impossible any longer to pose as the
champion of the German party; and he had married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the sister of Duke Bor̆ivoj, of Bohemia, in order to
strengthen the alliance of the Slavs against the Franks.
As a part of his new policy, he was forced, for a time,
to encourage the movement of Methodius; and it was
during this period that the archbishop or one of his
followers converted and baptised Bor̆ivoj, and induced
him to found two churches in memory of St.
Clement of Rome, whose remains Cyril had discovered
in his expedition to the Chazars.</p>

<p>There seems some difficulty in ascertaining how far
the Slavonic ritual came into general use in Bohemia
at this time. It is tolerably certain, on the one
hand, that Methodius did not desire to oppose the
authority of the Bishop of Regensburg, who claimed
to be primate over the Bohemian Christians; and that
bishop, like all the German prelates, was opposed to
the spread of the Slavonic ritual. On the other hand,
it is clear that, as Christianity grew in Bohemia,
it connected itself with Slavonic traditions; and we
find that in less than a century from this time the
Bohemian congregations had adopted a Slavonic
hymn as a necessary part of their ritual.</p>

<p>But, however slow the progress of Slavonic Christianity
may have been in Bohemia, Methodius does
not seem to have excited there that savage hostility
which he continued to provoke in Moravia. Svatopluk
and his courtiers were, no doubt, indignant at the higher
morality preached by Methodius; and one of the
claimants of the German Empire, with whom Svatopluk
was alternately in alliance and enmity, resented
extremely the authority claimed by Methodius over
Pannonia as well as Moravia. But, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
strengthen their position, the opponents of Methodius
took advantage of his having come from Constantinople,
to attack him as a rebel against the Pope,
and a supporter of the Greek heresy of the Single
Procession.</p>

<p class="caption">CYRIL AND METHODIUS, FROM THE WINDOW OF A CHURCH
IN CAROLINEN-THAL.</p>

</div>

<p>The first of these charges was singularly inconsistent
with the traditions of both the brothers, who led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the mission to the Slavs. Cyril had been partially
induced to go on his mission to the Chazars by the
unfriendly relations which had arisen between him
and the Patriarch of Constantinople. While in the
Chersonesus he had discovered the bones of the Roman
saint, Clement, who had died there; and he had ever
since recognised this saint as the special patron of his
mission to the Slavs. After Cyril and Methodius had
established themselves in Moravia, they had applied
to Rome for sanction to their work; and when they
had been summoned to the Court of the Pope, in consequence
of this application, Cyril had been so much
attracted to the place that he had entered a Roman
monastery, and had abandoned the mission, for the
future, to Methodius. Methodius, on his part, seems
to have been little inclined to resist authority, where
no moral or religious principle was concerned. So in
879 he readily accepted the summons to appear
before the Roman Synod, and easily convinced Pope
John VIII. of his willingness to obey him. Methodius
was equally happy in vindicating his orthodoxy
in the matter of the Double Procession.</p>

<p>But when these points had been settled, there still
remained the real subjects of dispute. These were
the lawfulness of the Slavonic ritual, and the position
of Methodius as Archbishop of Moravia. Svatopluk
had thrown himself with eagerness into the cause of
Methodius’s opponents, and joined in the denunciation
of the Slavonic ritual, declaring that it degraded
worship by connecting it with a barbarous dialect. The
champions of the Latin ritual attempted to strengthen
their cause by referring to the inscription written by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Pilate on the Cross in Hebrew and Greek and Latin.
This argument brought them the nickname of Pilatici,
or followers of Pilate, while Methodius and his disciples
appealed, in answer, to the authority of the Apostles,
who, on the Day of Pentecost, had uttered in all
languages the wonderful works of God. Pope John
seems clearly to have understood that the opposition
to Methodius arose rather from prejudice of race than
from ecclesiastical principle; and he recognised this
fact in the Bull which sanctioned the Slavonic ritual.
For in this document he expressly required that all
the clergy in the diocese of Moravia and Pannonia,
whether Slav <i>or of whatever race they might be</i>,
should be submissive to the archbishop. A very
noteworthy modification was subjoined to this decision
which seemed to stamp a popular and democratic
character on the Slavonic movement. “If
Svatopluk,” said the Pope, “and the members of his
Court desire to use the Latin ritual, they may do so
still.”</p>

<p>An even more crushing blow to the hopes of the
enemies of Methodius was given in a second decision
of the Pope. The German party had persuaded
Svatopluk to appoint a preacher named Wiching as
Bishop of Nitra in Pannonia, thereby hoping at any
rate to counterbalance the authority of Methodius.
Pope John, however, decided that he would only
recognise this appointment on condition that Wiching
acknowledged the archbishop as his superior; and he
expressly recommended Svatopluk to choose his next
bishop with the advice and consent of Methodius. So
alarmed were Wiching and his friends at this letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
from the Pope that they succeeded in suppressing it,
before it could reach Svatopluk; and they forged
another in which the Pope was made to say that
Methodius had indeed recanted his heresy about the
Double Procession; but that he was forbidden to use
the Slavonic ritual, and that Bishop Wiching was
appointed to carry out the papal decrees.</p>

<p>Methodius denied the genuineness of the document,
and wrote to Rome for another letter. John confirmed
his former decree, and summoned Wiching to
Rome to answer for his proceedings. Wiching, however,
refused to go; and he was backed in his opposition
both by Svatopluk and by Arnulf, the claimant
of the Empire, whose hold over Pannonia had been
one of the chief causes of the opposition to the
episcopal authority of Methodius.</p>

<p>The relations between Methodius and Svatopluk,
always hostile, would now have probably culminated
in the death or exile of the archbishop, but that a
quarrel broke out between Svatopluk and Arnulf; and
the desire of Svatopluk to overthrow Arnulf’s influence
in Pannonia naturally hindered his action against
Methodius. For the few remaining years of the archbishop’s
life, he was able to carry on his work, both
moral and religious, with much less opposition; but
when, after his death, his friends attempted to get his
pupil Gorazd appointed as successor in the archbishopric,
Wiching succeeded in stirring up Svatopluk
against him, in renewing the alliance with Arnulf, and
finally in securing the expulsion from Moravia of the
leading followers of Methodius. But in spite of the
opposition of dukes and Germans, the Slavonic ritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
held its own in Moravia, and Svatopluk’s son Mojmir
became its champion against the bishops of Salzburg.</p>

<p>Important, however, as the defence of the Slavonic
language and ritual was in the history of Bohemia
and Moravia, the enemy against whom it had specially
served as a watchword had ceased to become the object
of uncompromising hostility. A new power had
made its way into Europe, more dangerous, for the
moment, to Slavonic unity and Bohemian independence
than Frank, Saxon, or Bavarian; and the
Bohemians and Moravians were for a time compelled
to forget their fears and hatred of the Germans, in
order to combine with them against a new enemy.</p>

<h2>II.<br />
<span class="smaller">BOHEMIAN SAINTS AND WARRIORS IN THE TENTH
CENTURY.<br />
(885-997.)</span></h2>

<p>The ideal of life and character hinted at in the
Libus̆in Saud affects, in an often contradictory way,
the popular judgments of the prominent characters of
Bohemian history. So strangely does this tendency
manifest itself at more than one stage of the story,
that it would almost seem as if the ordinary conceptions
of national greatness, and sometimes even
of independence, were entirely obscured by the
Christian aspiration after a peaceable national life.
Kings and warriors, who had done much to extend
the prestige and power of Bohemia, are remembered
mainly for their cruelty and oppression; while saints,
who may in some degree have weakened the sense of
Bohemian independence, are not merely honoured,
but are even put forward as the symbols of distinctive
national life. Thus, for instance, Svatopluk, the cruel
and unscrupulous persecutor of Methodius and his
followers, might, from the ordinary nationalist point
of view, have been looked upon as the establisher of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Slavonic greatness, the champion of Moravian independence,
and even the protector of Bohemia and
Moravia against a cruel and barbarous invader.</p>

<p>Under his rule Moravia had become the centre of
a great Slavonic alliance extending eastwards to
Bulgaria and northwards to Magdeburg. The exact
relations between the dukedom of Moravia and the
other States referred to may be difficult to define;
but the whole story of his relations with Bohemia
shows that Svatopluk exercised an authority there
which was, at least, equal to that maintained by the
German Emperor over many of the states subject to
him; and we may fairly assume that he held a somewhat
similar position towards the other Slavonic
States which surrounded him.</p>

<p>Such a position, in the then condition of Europe,
could not but excite rivalry and jealousy among
the neighbouring princes; and Arnulf, the Duke of
Pannonia, who had aspired to the throne of the
Frankish Empire, was particularly jealous of a man
whose power, as he considered, had been largely due
to the patronage which Arnulf had granted to him.
The exact merits of the numerous quarrels between
these princes it is impossible to estimate accurately;
but it is clear that, as Svatopluk gained power, he
became more and more resolved to throw off
the authority which Arnulf found difficult to assert.
At last Arnulf, having lost hope of maintaining his
authority by his own force, and perhaps suspecting
that Pannonia would itself fall a prey to his rival,
resolved to call in a new ally to his assistance.</p>

<p>The emperors of Constantinople had followed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
tradition of the Western Empire, by playing off their
barbarian invaders against one another. And, as the
Romans had used their alliance with the Goths to
drive back the hordes of Attila, so the Emperor of
Constantinople had called on the descendants of
Attila’s followers to protect the decaying empire
from the inroads of the Bulgarians.</p>

<p>It was apparently in the latter part of the sixth
century that the Hungarians, or, as some called
them, the Turks, had been driven into Europe by
the pressure of other Asiatic races. They had
been hospitably received at Constantinople, and,
after various fortunes, had settled, in the eighth
century, among the Chazars. But they were never
allowed to remain long in one place; and it was in
consequence of their alliance with the Emperors of
the East that they overran Transylvania, and secured
their first settlement in their future kingdom. Even
here, however, they were not allowed to remain
quietly, and another tribe succeeded in driving them
out of Transylvania for a time.</p>

<p>It was while this contest was at its height that the
new invaders attracted the attention of Arnulf; and,
in the year 892, finding himself in a desperate plight,
he persuaded the Hungarians to join him in an
invasion of Moravia. Svatopluk fought gallantly
against his enemies, and more than once repelled
them from his dukedom; but, in 894, he was finally
defeated by the combined forces of his opponents.
Then comes in a story which illustrates in a startling
manner the Bohemian feeling that no military successes
could atone for acts of cruelty and treachery. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Svatopluk was undoubtedly fighting for the independence
of his country, he was seized, according to this
legend, with so extreme a fit of penitence for his
crimes, that he fled from the battle to a secret place
in the mountains, where he killed his horse, buried
his sword in the ground, and lived and died a hermit.
What gives a still stranger flavour to the legend is
the cause which Cosmas assigns for the Duke’s
penitence; for this cause was not his persecution of
Methodius, but his ingratitude to Arnulf.</p>

<p>The ruin of the Moravian dukedom speedily
followed. According to one tradition, Wiching,
Svatopluk’s German bishop, was used by Arnulf
to stir up division between the sons of Svatopluk.
If so, he must undoubtedly have used his influence
in favour of the younger Svatopluk, and against
Mojmir, the champion of the Slavonic ritual. But,
whatever the cause of division, the fact of the civil
war is undoubted; and all the enemies of the
country took advantage of it. In 896 the Hungarians
again invaded Moravia, and this time with much
greater success. The struggle was, however, continued
for a few years longer, during which the
Emperor endeavoured to assist Mojmir; but at last,
in 907, Mojmir was killed in battle, and the old
dukedom of Moravia was completely destroyed.</p>

<p class="caption">TOMB OF ST. LUDMILA.</p>

</div>

<p>Although the overthrow of this powerful State
broke down, for a time, a barrier between the savage
invaders and the settled governments of Europe,
it seems, strangely enough, to have produced less
immediate evil to Bohemia than to the German
principalities. It is, however, easy to understand that
the protection and championship of a neighbouring
State by such a ruler as Svatopluk may have had its
disadvantages, both in checking the independence of
the country protected, and in involving it in wars in
which it had little interest. Indeed, it appears as if
Bor̆ivoj and his immediate successors were too much
concerned with the internal struggles of their country,
to take much immediate interest in the apparently
larger issues which were being settled in the neighbouring
States. The Bohemian struggles were mainly
concerned with the rivalry between heathens and
Christians. The zeal of Bor̆ivoj for the new faith
soon irritated a large number of his subjects against
him; and, being unwilling to maintain his authority
by force of arms, he abdicated in favour of his son
Spitihnĕv. In the latter we seem to catch a glimpse
of a premature champion of toleration, who, while
desiring to encourage the progress of Christianity,
resented the excessive influence of the Christian
priests, and declared that he was equally the king
of his heathen and Christian subjects alike. This,
however, was a position that it was obviously impossible
to maintain at such a transitional period;
and, after Spitihnĕv’s death, Bor̆ivoj, being recalled
to the throne, resolved that the propagation of his
creed should not again suffer by the laxity of his
family. He therefore put his second son, Vratislav,
under the special care of Methodius; and, after
Bor̆ivoj and Methodius were both dead, Vratislav’s
mother, Ludmila, continued to influence him in
favour of the new faith. But the power of Ludmila
was counteracted, especially among the nobles, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
her daughter-in-law Drahomíra, who became the
centre of the heathen opposition to Ludmila and
the clergy; and she trained her son Boleslav to follow
in her footsteps. Vratislav’s other son, Václav (or,
as we call him, Wenceslaus), was protected from
Drahomíra’s influence by his grandmother Ludmila;
and thus the two brothers became the champions, the
one of the Christian, and the other of the heathen
party, in the State. The Duke was so little conscious
of the mischief that was brewing that, after building
the town of Bolislava in honour of his younger son,
he celebrated the occasion by building a church in
that town in honour of Cyril and Methodius; and he
apparently sanctioned that division of his territory
between his sons which was carried out after his
death. No sooner, however, was Vratislav dead,
than Drahomíra commanded the Christians to close
their churches; and this order was speedily followed
by a massacre; nor was Wenceslaus able to save even
his grandmother Ludmila from the vengeance of his
mother. Indeed, this favourite saint of the Bohemians
seems to have had so little vigour, as a ruler, that he
could not protect even the clergy, whom he most
desired to favour, from the intimidation of Boleslav
and Drahomíra. Thus, for instance, when he invited
the Bishop of Regensburg to consecrate a new church
at Prague, the bishop was so terrified by the threats
of his enemies that he dared not come. It would,
indeed, be unjust to deny that the position of a
Christian Duke in the midst of this sudden revival
of heathenism was a most difficult and dangerous
one; nor is there the smallest ground to suspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Wenceslaus of personal cowardice. On the contrary,
he is represented on two occasions as offering personal
combat to an invading prince, in order to save his
country from the evils of war; and no doubt,
according to his lights, he was very willing to
sacrifice himself for the good of Bohemia. Yet
one cannot but detect certain weaknesses in his
career, which may well have alarmed some of the
stronger, if coarser, statesmen, who stood near the
throne; and though he distinguished himself by
many acts of benevolence and devotion, and succeeded
on several occasions in preserving peace and
preventing bloodshed, yet it was not wholly by his
virtues that he excited the indignation of the party
led by his brother. The tendency to encourage those
who were engaged in other work to become priests,
and his excessive reliance on the authority of the
Emperor, might well have given occasion to a more
reasonable opposition than that which expressed itself
in the mere persecution of the Christians.</p>

<p>Nor is it a wholly satisfactory sign that his piety,
like that of Edward the Confessor, took the form of
a contempt for marriage, or, to use the ecclesiastical
phrase, of the zeal for preserving his virginity. He
was therefore probably in the right when he meditated
retiring into a Benedictine monastery; but the Pope,
glad enough, no doubt, to secure a Christian Duke on
the throne of a half-converted nation, threw great
difficulties in the way of his abdication. His mother
and brother, indignant at the frustration of their
hopes, resolved on murder; and as a first step, to
their purpose, they invited Wenceslaus to be present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
at the baptism of the son of Boleslav. So unexpected
a concession to Christianity aroused the suspicions
of Wenceslaus; but his religion throughout seems to
have had a touch of fatalism, and he went to the
feast in the full expectation of death. While the
revelry was at its height, he withdrew from the table
to worship in the church; and it was there that
Boleslav found him and murdered him, while he
clung to the door of the church for safety. The
murder was followed by a general massacre of the
Christian priests, among whom is especially mentioned
Podiven, the follower known to English readers
as having warmed his feet by treading in the footsteps
of his master.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The German Emperor was naturally indignant at
the murder of his faithful <i>protégé</i>; and he exacted
from Boleslav, as the price of peace, the recall of the
banished Christians, the renewal of the tribute which
he had just remitted to Wenceslaus, and an oath of
allegiance, such as had hitherto been paid to the
Emperor only by German princes. Boleslav was
apparently induced to submit to these severe terms,
partly by his fear of the power of the Emperor, partly
by a sense of the danger which was still threatening
the civilised States of Europe, a danger which could
only be faced by an alliance with the new ruler who
had arisen in Germany. For while Bor̆ivoj and his
successors had been struggling to assert their power
over their heathen subjects, the old Saxon kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
had succeeded in producing a champion of European
freedom and civilisation.</p>

<p>Henry the Fowler had thrown off the effete yoke
of the Franks, and rallied the Germans under his
banner; he had then routed the Hungarians at the
celebrated battle of Merseburg, and had founded towns,
by which a new order of civilisation was being introduced
into Germany. His son Otto was vigorously
carrying on the struggle against the Hungarians;
and Boleslav, however much he might dislike foreign
rule, saw that an alliance with Otto was the only hope
for his country. The Hungarians were now advancing
into Bohemia, and Boleslav encountered them on
the frontier and completely defeated them. He then
proceeded to suppress a robber tribe who had given
much trouble to Wenceslaus, and who had established
a castle on the borders of Bohemia, from whence they
had harassed the country.</p>

<p>The chroniclers declare that Drahomíra was
swallowed up in an earthquake, and perhaps her
death removed the chief anti-Christian influence in
the life of Boleslav; for, to whatever motives of conviction
or policy the change may have been due, it
is evident that, from this time forward, he not merely
abandoned his persecution of the Christians, but used
all his power to encourage their influence. The son
whose baptism had been the occasion of the murder
of Wenceslaus, became a monk; while the second son
was trained with such effect in the principles of Christianity
that he afterwards gained the name of Boleslav
the Pious. But to the father of these princes the
Bohemian chroniclers are as inexorable as they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
been to Svatopluk; and, while Wenceslaus is remembered
as one of the chief national saints of Bohemia,
his brother lives in history as Boleslav the Cruel.</p>

<p>If the weaknesses of Wenceslaus tend to diminish
our sympathies with the movement of which he is the
champion and martyr, we may perhaps feel a more
undivided interest in the next phase of the development
of Bohemian Christianity, and a more unmixed
admiration for the saint who represents that period.
There were two demands made by the Christian
leaders in Bohemia which specially connected
patriotism with religion. These were the claim for
a Slavonic ritual, and the attempt to establish an
independent bishopric at Prague. But, though both
of these claims sprang from the feeling of national independence,
it was only the question of the bishopric,
which appealed to such champions of Bohemia as
Boleslav the Cruel. That strong and deep longing
for the protection and development of the national
language, which expressed itself, at this time, in the
cry for the Methodian ritual, was not a feeling which
the mere military champions of Bohemia could understand
or recognise. The Pope seems to have been
conscious of this division, and to have availed
himself of it to make more grudging concessions
to the national feeling than the merits of Boleslav
the Pious, and the memory of St. Wenceslaus might
seem to have demanded. He granted, indeed, the
free election of a bishop of Prague, and sanctioned, at
the same time, the foundation of a nunnery of which
Boleslav’s sister was to be abbess; but he clogged
the latter concession by the condition that the Slavonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
ritual should not be used in the new nunnery. Perhaps
it was a similar desire for compromise which led
Boleslav to recommend to his clergy and people, for
the first bishop, a Saxon named Dettmar, who, however,
was noted for his knowledge of the Bohemian
language. Friendship with Saxony was doubtless
attractive to the wiser men of Bohemia, for more than
one reason. It was the centre of that resistance to
the Hungarian power which they felt to be so vital
to European civilisation. It contained a large proportion
of men of Slavonic race; and Magdeburg,
where Dettmar had been trained, was the great home
of such learning and culture as were then to be found
in Germany.</p>

<p>But the fierce heathen spirit, which had been
strengthened by Boleslav the Cruel, could not be suppressed
at once either by his conversion, or by the
probably sincerer piety of his son. It is now that the
strong and cruel aristocracy of Bohemia begin to
show their power both against king and people. Even
in heathen times we hear of at least one family who
claimed a sort of equality with the royal line, and who
continued during the tenth and eleventh centuries to
play much the same part as that of the Douglases
in Scotland in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
There was, however, one important difference between
the cases. With all their selfishness and unscrupulousness,
the Douglases always stood by Scotland
against its external enemies, while the Vrs̆ovici were
continually betraying Bohemia to Pole or German
in order to gain their own ends. Nor were the
Vrs̆ovici the only specimens of a lawless and cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
class; and Boleslav the Pious and Bishop Dettmar
soon incurred the hatred of that class. The bishop,
however, did not long survive his appointment; and
he was soon to be succeeded by a man far more
notable in Bohemian history. This man was Vojtĕch,
the son of a powerful Bohemian noble, who was as
distinguished for his virtues as for his wealth and
rank. Vojtĕch, by the advice of Dettmar, had been
sent by his parents to study at Magdeburg; and on
his entrance into the clerical profession, he had received
from the Archbishop of Magdeburg his name
of Adalbert. When he returned to Bohemia, he was
called to succeed Dettmar in the bishopric of Prague.
He soon began to denounce the state of morals
around him. Divorce was frequent; impurity of all
kinds terribly rife; and the nobles, not content with
oppression at home, were constantly selling their
unfortunate dependants into slavery. The stern denunciations
of Adalbert soon roused against him the
hatred of his own class, which was increased in
bitterness by the rivalry between his family and that
of the Vrs̆ovici.</p>

<p>On one occasion a woman, whom he had saved
from her angry husband and sent into a nunnery, was
dragged out and murdered by her husband. Boleslav
desired to repress such violence by the sword; Adalbert
at first persuaded him to abstain from bloodshed;
but, when the insurgent nobles built a fortress on the
banks of the Elbe, from which they harassed all the
Christians who came that way, the king felt bound
to act; so he marched against the insurgents and
signally defeated them. Adalbert, horrified at being
in any way the cause of bloodshed, fled to Pannonia,
which had now been conquered by the Hungarians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Geysa, the leading chief of the Hungarians in that
district, was a hospitable and large-minded man, who
welcomed strangers heartily. Adalbert used the
opportunity to teach Christianity, and many of the
Hungarians were converted. Amongst other converts
was Geysa himself, who consented to have his
son Stephen christened by Adalbert. Over this child
Adalbert’s influence was evidently great; and when
Stephen grew up, he became the first Christian king
of Hungary, recognised as such both by Pope and
Emperor. From the reign of St. Stephen the Hungarians
themselves reckon their beginning as a settled
monarchy; and thus they owe their change from the
condition of a marauding horde to an orderly and
progressive nation, to the teaching of the Bohemian
saint.</p>

<p>Twice Adalbert was recalled to Bohemia, and twice
he again left it in disgust. On the last occasion he
took refuge with the King of Poland, and from thence
went to convert the heathen Prussians, by whom he
was killed. His body was brought back by the Poles
and buried at Gnesen. Next to the actual memory
of his life, his most notable legacy to his country is
the hymn which he wrote in the native language, and
which soon became, and long remained, a kind of
war-cry of Bohemian independence.</p>

<span class="smaller">RELATIONS OF BOHEMIA TO POLAND AND TO THE
EMPIRE IN THE ELEVENTH, TWELFTH, AND
THIRTEENTH CENTURIES.<br />
(997-1253.)</span></h2>

<p>The invasion of the Hungarians had changed the
attitude of Bohemia, as of other countries, towards the
German Empire. The necessity of saving themselves
from the ruin which overwhelmed the dukedom of
Moravia, naturally compelled the Bohemians to recognise
their former enemies as their only sure protectors;
and, as the vigorous line of Saxon princes put new
force into the German kingdom, this relation became
necessarily closer. But it was long before the German
rulers were able to realise that they could gain any
help, in turn, from the rising dukedom of Bohemia.
Torn by the divisions between heathen and Christian,
distracted to an unusual degree by family quarrels,
harassed by powerful neighbours, Bohemia seemed,
in the tenth and early part of the eleventh century,
more fitted to be the tool or the prey of the Emperors
than their ally. Nor was it only a weakening of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
internal security which had been produced by the
Magyar invasion. The break-up of Slavonic unity,
by the overthrow of Svatopluk, had caused a confusion
of races in certain districts, which made them
the subject of dispute between rival powers.</p>

<p>Of these mixed lands, the two in which Bohemia
was most interested, were the district of Lusatia
(afterwards called the Lausitz), over which she disputed
with Saxony, and the even more variously
peopled province of Silesia, which was the great
cause of controversy between Bohemia and Poland.
Of these two subjects of difference the Silesian question
was the far more pressing and important. The
common feeling of danger, produced by Hungarian
invasion, had, indeed, affected Poland as much as
other European countries; but, as the raids of the
invaders grew less frequent, the sense of union,
developed by that danger, grew weaker; and when
the Hungarians began to settle down as a peaceable
and Christian nation, the Poles began to abandon
their defensive attitude, and gradually to become
aggressive in their turn.</p>

<p>Nor was the Silesian question the only cause of
jealousy between Poland and Bohemia. The town of
Cracow, the former capital of Croatia, was as much
desired by both the rival nations as Silesia could be;
since it was important both for military and political
purposes. Moreover those ecclesiastical considerations,
which were always influencing the foreign
politics of Bohemia, played a somewhat important
part in the struggle with Poland. The desire of the
Polish Duke to secure the burial of Adalbert at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Gnesen had not been wholly due to religious feelings.
The kings and bishops of Poland wished to make
Gnesen the centre of a large diocese, in which Prague
should hold a subordinate position; and an offer
of money which the Duke of Poland made to a
Bohemian monastery founded by Adalbert, was no
doubt intended as a bribe to the monks, to induce
them to further these schemes of ecclesiastical and
political ambition. These enterprises were unfortunately
aided by that treacherous family, the Vrs̆ovici,
who had already played so fatal a part in their
country’s history. They seem to have again tried to
carry out their treasons by stirring up family jealousy.
Young Boleslav, a nephew of Boleslav the Pious,
showed himself eager to assert his claims to the
Dukedom of Bohemia. Mĕs̆ek of Poland encouraged
his kinsman’s intrigues, and, by a sudden surprise,
Cracow was seized, and Silesia was overrun by the
Polish troops.</p>

<p>Boleslav the Pious demanded reparation for this
outrage, and circumstances soon gave him the opportunity
for revenge. A Russian chief unexpectedly
invaded Poland and laid waste a great part of it.
Boleslav the Pious seized this opportunity to recover
Cracow, and he placed there a governor of sufficient
vigour to hold the fortress against all attempts of the
Poles to recover it, even after they had succeeded in
making peace with Russia. Indeed the new governor
would willingly have extended the Bohemian territory
by making reprisals on Poland; but this was strictly
forbidden by the Duke of Bohemia.</p>

<p>The death of Boleslav the Pious, and the accession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to the dukedom of his weak and profligate son,
Boleslav the Third, gave a new opportunity both to
native and foreign intrigues. Indeed the Vrs̆ovici
are represented by some historians as acting in this
reign rather the part of patriotic opponents of a
tyrant than of selfish intriguers for power. It is,
however, unfortunately clear that they did not
abandon their intrigues with the Polish pretender;
and he was able to take advantage of the non-payment
of the soldiers in the garrison of Cracow to
stir up division in the fortress. By this means he
was once more able to surprise the garrison, and to
put all the Bohemians to the sword. Great confusion
now followed; the German Emperor, Henry II.,
seized the opportunity of fishing in troubled waters,
and something like a conquest of Bohemia by Poland
was for a time the result of this struggle. The
accounts, however, of the details of the struggle seem
uncertain and contradictory; and it is not until the
Bohemians had in some measure re-established their
independence that we once more find ourselves on
firm ground.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, it is just when we have reached
a point at which modern research and early tradition
seem to be in practical harmony that we light upon a
series of stories of the most romantic kind. Oldr̆ich,
the brother of Boleslav III., had been established on
the throne after the expulsion of the Poles. He seems
to have been an eccentric prince, given to somewhat
unconventional explorations of his kingdom. In one
of these wanderings he came upon a handsome
peasant-girl washing clothes in a stream. He at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
once fell in love with her, and soon after woo’d, won,
and married her. The great ladies of the court at
first resented the arrival of the peasant-queen; but in
time the grace and courtesy of Beatrix broke down
the opposition of her jealous critics, and the birth of
her son Brac̆islav was celebrated with splendid feasts.
Brac̆islav was to be the future hero and restorer of
the greatness of his country; and, as usual, the
political and military revival of Bohemia is preluded
by a reawakening of the interest in the national
language.</p>

<p>In another of his wanderings Oldr̆ich found, in the
depth of the forest, an old hermit, to whom he confessed
his sins; and he was so much impressed by
the power and saintliness of the man, that he persuaded
him to leave his solitary life, to return to the
town, and to assist the duke and other pious men in
founding the monastery of Sázava. He soon found
that this hermit had in his keeping copies of the
old Slavonic services introduced into Bohemia by
Methodius, which had doubtless disappeared from
the country in the recent troubles. Encouraged by
Oldr̆ich, and at a later time by his son Brac̆islav, the
national ritual was rapidly extended from Sázava to
other churches.</p>

<p>Oldr̆ich bequeathed to his son both his zeal for the
national language and the national independence, and
also the love of romantic adventure. Even before his
accession to the throne, Brac̆islav had attracted attention
as a hero of romance. He had made a sudden
expedition to the nunnery of Schweinfurt, to carry
off from thence the beautiful daughter of a German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Count. The gate of the nunnery was secured by a
bar; but Brac̆islav cut through the bar with his sword,
and carried off his bride in triumph, though some
of his followers were cut off and killed. But the
great purpose of his life was to recover the ground
which Bohemia had lost in her struggle with Poland.
Even before his accession to the throne, he had reconquered
the greater part of the province of Moravia,
which the Poles had torn away from Bohemia; and,
as soon as he became duke, he resolved to carry his
plans yet further, and to invade Poland itself. The
death of Duke Casimir of Poland, and the infancy of
his successor, facilitated this expedition. Brac̆islav
retook Cracow by storm, overran much of Silesia,
and transplanted many of the Poles to Bohemia,
where he suffered them to maintain their old laws
and customs. He then marched to Gnesen, the centre
of the intended scheme for establishing the ecclesiastical
supremacy of Poland over Bohemia. The
city was ill-defended, and Brac̆islav entered it in
triumph.</p>

<p>Then followed one of those scenes which show
how strangely the fiercer elements in the Bohemian
character were checked and crossed by influences like
those of St. Wenceslaus and St. Adalbert. It will be
remembered that the body of the latter saint had
been buried by the king of Poland at Gnesen, and
Brac̆islav had many motives for desiring to recover
so valuable a possession. But the scene which preceded
the restoration of the national saint to the
country, which had so ill-treated him during his life,
is curiously unlike the ordinary performances of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
military conqueror; and, if there are any who think
that such a mediæval legend is beneath the dignity
of history, they should remember that the historian
Cosmas, who has preserved it for us, was a man
actively engaged in the ordinary political affairs of
his time.</p>

<p>At first the Bohemians were disposed to carry
things with a high hand; and, in spite of the warnings
of the chief pastor of the town, they tore down
the altar which covered the body, in order to seize it
the more easily. For this offence they were struck
dumb and blind for the space of three hours; and on
recovering their senses they consented to submit to
a three days’ fast before taking further action. On
the third day the same priest, who had warned them
of the consequences of their sacrilege, told them that
he had had a vision of St. Adalbert; and that the
saint had bidden him to tell the Duke and his companions
that the Father in Heaven would give them
what they asked, if they did not repeat those evil
deeds which they abjured in their baptism. On
the morning following this announcement, the
Duke and his followers entered the church and
prostrated themselves before the tomb of St.
Adalbert. Then the Duke arose and addressed
them as follows: “Do you wish to amend your
errors and to turn from evil works to wisdom?”
To this they answered, “We are prepared to amend
whatever our fathers or we have done wrong against
this saint of God, and to cease from every evil work.”
Then the Duke, extending his hand over the sacred
tomb, addressed the crowd as follows: “Stretch out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
my brothers, your hands to God, and listen to my
discourses, which I wish you to confirm your faith in
by an oath. Therefore, let this be my first and most
urgent decree; that your marriages, which you have
hitherto treated as if they were mere fornications, and
like the union of brute animals, should in future be
made lawful, according to canonical rules, private and
indissoluble, so that each husband shall be content
with one wife, and each wife with one husband. But,
if a wife shall despise a husband, or a husband his
wife, and if a quarrel between them shall boil over
into a separation, then I do not will that the one of
them that refuses to return to lawful union shall be
made a slave according to the custom of our land;
but rather that, by the slavery of our unchangeable
decree, such persons, whoever they may be, shall be
carried into Hungary; and it shall not be permitted
to them to buy their liberty, or to return to this land,
lest the contagion of one little sheep should creep into
the whole sheep-fold of Christ.” Then the pastor of
the church answered: “Let him who does otherwise
be anathema.”</p>

<p>After further provisions for enforcing purity of life,
the Duke added, “But, if a woman shall have declared
publicly that she was not loved as an equal, but was
afflicted and persecuted by her husband, let the judgment
of God be given between them; and let the one
who is found guilty pay the penalty.” Further provisions
were then introduced for punishing homicides;
but with regard to murderers of fathers,
brothers, or priests, they were to be bound by hand
and belly with iron, and sent out of the kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to wander, like Cain, over the whole earth. Those,
again, who set up taverns, which are the source of all
crimes and impurities, were to be anathema; and he
who was caught in the act of keeping a tavern was
to be hung, and his drinks to be poured out upon the
earth, lest any one should be polluted by this execrable
draught. Further provisions then followed against
holding markets or doing servile works on Sunday,
and against burial of the dead in unconsecrated
places.</p>

<p>After these sins had been denounced as offensive
unto God, and as the cause why St. Adalbert left his
native country, all present were called upon to assent
to the changes of conduct proposed. When they had
done so the archbishop broke open the tomb, and
disclosed the body of the saint. So delicious, says
Cosmas, was the smell which came out that many
seemed as if they had tasted rich food, and for three
days they needed no more; many sick were healed;
yet only the Duke, the archbishop, and the nobles
were suffered to see the body. They then prayed
St. Adalbert to allow them to carry him to Prague;
and the Duke and bishop, taking the body from the
tomb, wrapped it in silk, and set out with it in a
solemn procession. After the body were carried the
spoils taken from the Poles; and the Polish nobles
(among whom was the great-grandfather of Cosmas)
followed the procession as prisoners, their hands and
necks being loaded with irons.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that Brac̆islav’s proceedings
would pass unchallenged; and both Pope
and Emperor were appealed to, to redress the wrongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
done to the Church and to Poland. Both of them
answered the appeal; but the complaints of the Pope
were soon silenced by the building of a monastery,
and by the judicious distribution of money among the
cardinals. Henry III. was not so easily satisfied.
He had doubtless adopted the Imperial policy of
playing off the rival kingdoms against each other;
and the Bohemian victories, won so easily, and without
his intervention, were most unwelcome. His
avarice, moreover, was roused by the news of
the booty which Brac̆islav had brought back from
Poland. He therefore peremptorily demanded the
surrender of the spoil, under pain of war. Brac̆islav
boldly replied that, “while the Bohemians were willing
to pay to the Emperor that tribute which they had
always paid him, they would resist to the death any
attempt to lay on them unlawful burdens.” Henry
retorted that the law had a wax nose, which a king
could always bend with his iron hand.</p>

<p>Such an exchange of courtesies was naturally
followed by war; and, while a Saxon army marched
into Bohemia on one side, the Emperor himself
speedily followed by another entrance. But the
Bohemians were ready for the invasion; and, while
the imperial army were resting in a wood, they were
surprised by Brac̆islav’s soldiers and cut to pieces,
Henry only saving himself by the swiftness of his
horse. The Duke of Saxony in vain tried to make
terms with the Bohemians, and was speedily forced
to retreat to his own country.</p>

<p>This success, indeed, was not quite so complete
as it seemed at first; for, in the following year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Henry once more invaded Bohemia, and gained such
successes that Brac̆islav was compelled to pay a
higher tribute, and to restore many towns to Poland.
Nevertheless, he was able to retain some hold even
over those towns, by exacting a perpetual tribute
from them; nor was Bohemia ever again so completely
at the mercy of Poland as it had been in the
previous reigns.</p>

<p>The divisions in the Bohemian Ducal family
seemed, however, to Brac̆islav to be as great a danger
as could arise from any foreign enemy; and he
persuaded the nobles to guard against such dangers
in the future by making the crown hereditary in his
family, and abandoning the unlimited right of election.
Such a law could not finally prevent family quarrels,
or defeat the designs of ambitious adventurers. But
it is worth noting, as indicating the feeling of an able
ruler about the dangers to which his country was
exposed.</p>

<p>It will be easily understood that the conduct of
Henry III. and the Duke of Saxony had quickened
once more in Bohemia that anti-German feeling,
which the struggles with the Magyars and the
Poles had for a time forced into the background.
Brac̆islav had, no doubt, been statesman enough to
restrain such a feeling within due bounds; but, when
his son Spitihnĕv came to the throne, he gave far
fiercer expression to his hatred of the old enemies
of Bohemia. No sooner was he established in his
power, than he issued a decree ordering all the
Germans to leave the country; nor was even his
mother allowed an exemption from this sentence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
His brother Vratislav set himself against this policy,
and tried to make the province of Moravia a centre
of opposition to the king. But Spitihnĕv invaded
Moravia, forced Vratislav to fly to Hungary, and
treated his wife with such cruelty that she died from
the effects. In order to make his power yet more
secure, the Duke persuaded his other brothers, Otto
and Conrad, to abandon their claims to the special
districts of Moravia, which their father had granted
to them, and to come to the ducal court at Prague.</p>

<p>Spitihnĕv, however, like Svatopluk of Moravia
and Boleslav the Cruel, was one of those violent
men who are subject to reactions as inexplicable as
their first outbursts. Under the influence of the
Bishop of Prague, he consented to be reconciled to
Vratislav, and to allow him to return to Moravia;
and this concession was a prelude to a complete
change of policy. So mild, indeed, did he become,
that he gained the reputation of being a friend to
the poor, a just judge, and an encourager of religion.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say to which part of his reign we
are to assign an act, which seems at first sight a
strange contrast with his furious national prejudices.
This was his suppression of the Slavonic ritual in the
monastery of Sázava. But the apparent inconsistency
is easily explained. The Emperors and
Popes were no longer the props of each other’s power;
for Henry III. had struck out that new policy,
which aimed at the humiliation of the Papacy, and
the exaltation of the Empire at its expense. Under
these circumstances, a king of Bohemia who wished
to hurl defiance at the Germans and their ruler, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
necessarily forced to rely on the support of the Pope.
Now the very bitterness of the struggle against the
German Empire had crushed out those ideas of
tolerance towards national feeling which had prevailed
in the days of John VIII. The Slavonic ritual represented
at once a concession to the Greek heresy, and
a substitution of a national language for the Latin,
which symbolised the power of the Papacy. Spitihnĕv,
therefore, was obliged to suppress this incitement
to heresy before he could obtain the help of the
Papacy against the Emperor.</p>

<p>But, whatever changes might have marked the
closing years of Spitihnĕv’s reign, he could not hope
at once to suppress that fierce spirit of national hatred
which he had called into prominence; especially since
it had entwined itself, in many cases, with personal
ambitions and jealousies. When, then, Vratislav
succeeded to his brother’s dukedom, he found himself
in an exceptionally difficult position. The persecution
which he had suffered from his brother naturally
inclined him to a reversal of Spitihnĕv’s policy; but
he found that the rest of his family by no means
shared his desire for such a change. The most turbulent
and ambitious of his brothers was named
Jaromír. He had been early persuaded to enter
deacon’s orders, in the hope of ultimately succeeding
to the bishopric of Prague. Soon, however, he wearied
of a life for which he had no natural inclination; he
therefore fled to Poland, and entered the Polish army.
When, then, the Bishop of Prague died, Vratislav
naturally felt that any claim which Jaromír might
have founded on former promises, was cancelled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
his desertion of his profession; and this seemed a
good opportunity for introducing the new policy of
conciliation of the Germans. Vratislav, therefore,
offered the bishopric to a Saxon chaplain named
Lanczo. Though Saxon birth might have special
recommendations to those who remembered St. Adalbert’s
training at Magdeburg, yet, on the other hand,
the share which the Saxons had taken in the invasions
of Henry III. had produced a deep feeling of
resentment in many Bohemians. Conrad and Otto
resolved to give expression to these discontents, by
persuading Jaromír to renew his tonsure; and they
resolved to support his claim to the bishopric.</p>

<p>Vratislav hoped to solve the difficulty by an appeal
to a General Assembly. The Assembly met, and
Vratislav in their presence presented Lanczo with the
episcopal ring and staff. For a few moments dead
silence followed this act; then, after some mutterings
amongst themselves, several nobles sprang up, and
announced their intention to support the claims of
Jaromír by force of arms. The opposition was so
fierce that Vratislav yielded, and Jaromír was made
Bishop of Prague.</p>

<p>But the ambition of the new bishop was not yet
satisfied. It had been found necessary, in a previous
reign, to divide the diocese into two parts, one
Bohemian and one Moravian; and the Bishop of
Olomouci (Olmütz) was then made practically independent
of the Bishop of Prague. Jaromír now demanded
that the Bishop of Olmütz should be deposed,
and his diocese absorbed in the diocese of Prague. This
proposal was, of course, opposed by Vratislav; whereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Jaromír went secretly to Olmütz and assaulted
his rival bishop, injuring him severely. Vratislav
now felt that the time had come to appeal to the
Pope against his unruly brother. Alexander II. sent
a legate to Bohemia to try the case; but, though the
Duke and the nobles received him with great honour,
Jaromír denied the authority of the Papal emissary,
and refused to resign the see at his bidding.</p>

<p>This, however, was not a time when the Pope
could be bearded with impunity. In 1073 Alexander
died, and Hildebrand was chosen Pope, with the title
of Gregory VII. He summoned Jaromír to Rome;
and, after a short attempt at resistance, the turbulent
prince submitted to that powerful will. But even
Gregory had allies with whom he could not dispense;
and Matilda of Tuscany, who was connected with the
Bohemian ducal family, chose to interest herself on
Jaromír’s behalf, made up a temporary reconciliation
between the brothers, and persuaded the Pope to
restore Jaromír to the bishopric of Prague, after he
had performed some kind of penance, and had given
a promise to abstain from interference with the
Bishop of Olmütz. Jaromír, therefore, returned to
Bohemia, and continued to be a thorn in the side
of his brother, and of all his order-loving countrymen.</p>

<p>It is obvious that neither the conduct of Jaromír
nor of Gregory can have tended to sweeten Vratislav’s
feelings towards the anti-German party; and his
personal resentment and the desire for greater
security for his throne, doubtless mingled with larger
considerations, to recommend to him an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
change in Bohemian policy, which was vitally to
affect the future of the country.</p>

<p>Ever since the death of Henry II., the Bohemian
Dukes had had a new chance for playing a
part in the affairs of the German Empire. The six
German princes, to whom the Saxon Emperors had
wished to limit the right of election to the Empire,
had found it impossible, or at least, extremely difficult,
to come to a satisfactory decision on occasions
when the champions of rival candidates were equally
divided. So they were forced to add the Duke of
Bohemia as a seventh Elector, to secure a better
chance of a satisfactory decision, and in 1024 Duke
Oldr̆ich had actually taken part in an Imperial
Election. At that time, no doubt, the Emperors were
still strong enough to dispense with allies who were
not directly and naturally connected with the Empire;
but when the struggle with the Popes began, the
need for fresh support became more evident, and the
friendship of the new Elector of the Empire became
more valuable.</p>

<p>When, then, in 1075, Vratislav offered his help to
the Emperor in the struggle which was then becoming
desperate, his alliance was gladly welcomed.
Henry IV. had just then been excommunicated
by Gregory for his opposition to the Papal claims
over the German bishoprics; and he was threatened
with rebellion by some of his most powerful subjects.
Vratislav’s opportunity was therefore well chosen;
and throughout the many changes of fortune in his
stormy career, Henry found his new ally both faithful
and helpful. Many victories were gained by the help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of the Bohemian soldiers; and perhaps the most noteworthy
battle, as affecting the future Bohemian
history, was that at Mailberg in 1082, when Vratislav,
with the help of the Bavarians, defeated Leopold,
Margrave of Austria, who had just revolted against
Henry. The Emperor would gladly have presented
the Mark of Austria to the victorious Duke; but
Vratislav wisely shrank from this extension of his
dominions. Other offers of territory by Henry were
either declined by the Duke or found incapable of
execution; and at last, in 1086, the Emperor, finding
no other reward acceptable to his ally, publicly recognised
Vratislav as King of Bohemia, and released him
from tribute to the Empire.</p>

<p>Thus Bohemia passed for the moment from a
position of dependence to one of equal alliance
with the German Emperor. It might seem, indeed,
when one considers the later developments of
Bohemian history, as if the country would have
been happier had it held aloof from the quarrels
of Emperors and Popes, and developed itself on
narrower and more peaceful lines. But, by the statesmen
of that time, the matter must have been seen
in a very different light. The perpetual interference
by Emperors, Popes, and Kings of Poland in the
internal affairs of Bohemia seemed to have become
an unavoidable evil; and the only apparent remedy
was to seize the moment when the Emperor was in
difficulty, and to show him that his despised dependant
might become a necessary ally.</p>

<p>But the general character of Vratislav’s policy
justifies us in attributing to him higher motives than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
those above mentioned. He seems to have really
desired to encourage a wider development of thought
and culture in Bohemia. Both Germans and Jews
were granted special privileges to induce them to
settle in Prague; and it may well be believed that
he hoped to extend this connection between Bohemia
and the European world, by concerning himself with
the politics of the Empire.</p>

<p>Nor did he fail to do honour to native excellence.
One man in particular stands out amongst his
favourites, as a proof of Vratislav’s sympathy with
artistic power. This was Boz̆etĕch, who was distinguished
both as painter, sculptor, and architect.
Such a variety of excellence so attracted the Duke
that he appointed Boz̆etĕch as Abbot of Sázava;
and by his help he once more brought back into use
the often-disputed Slavonic ritual. Pope Gregory,
indeed, indignantly demanded its suppression; but
Vratislav, strong in the support of the Emperor and
of the general feeling of Bohemia, stood firm on
behalf of this symbol of national life. Unfortunately,
rulers who choose their favourites for merit rather
than for birth, naturally rouse the hostility of those
courtiers, who have only the latter claim to distinction;
and while Boz̆etĕch was sternly rebuked for
presumption by the Bishop of Prague, another
favourite of Vratislav’s gave offence to the heir to
the throne, and was murdered by the young prince
and his followers.</p>

<p>This act of violence is one proof among many that
Vratislav’s policy was too vigorous for the leaders
of Bohemian opinion. His successors could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
maintain Bohemia in the position in which he would
have placed her; and even the royal title fell into
disuse, in consequence, partly, of the disputes about
the succession. Indeed, the chief evidence of the
progress, which Bohemia had made under Vratislav,
is to be found in the fact that the internal quarrels
which followed his reign were not able to drag the
country down to the condition into which she had
previously fallen. Poland was not able to recover
her hold over Bohemia; and Henry IV. was so
conscious of his debt to Vratislav that he refused
to interfere in a contest between members of the
ducal family, on the ground that such questions
should be left to the free choice of the Bohemians
themselves.</p>

<p>In spite, then, of Vratislav’s partial success, the
divisions which followed his death could not fail to
weaken Bohemia; and at last one of the Dukes
resolved upon a terrible method for suppressing
internal disorder. This duke bore the name of
Svatopluk; and his career was not wholly unlike that
of his namesake in the old Moravian times. By the
help of Mutina and Boz̆ej, two of the leaders of the
Vrs̆ovici, he had deposed Duke Bor̆ivoj, and placed
himself upon the throne of Bohemia. Bor̆ivoj appealed
to Polish support for the recovery of his kingdom;
and, during Svatopluk’s absence, he invaded Bohemia
at the head of a Polish army. Mutina, who had been
left as one of Svatopluk’s chief representatives, offered
little resistance to the invaders, and he was, in consequence,
denounced to the Duke as having intrigued
with Bor̆ivoj. Thereupon Svatopluk resolved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
destroy the whole race of the Vrs̆ovici. He summoned
all the nobles to a banquet in Breslau; and
among them came Mutina, not suspecting what was
to follow. At the close of the banquet Svatopluk
suddenly turned upon Mutina, and accused him and
his family of being the authors of all the treasons in
Bohemia for many years past. Then he made a sign
to an officer, who rushed upon Mutina and cut off
his head as he was trying to rise from his seat.
His sons were then seized and their eyes put out.
Then messengers were despatched all over the
country, who hunted out every member of the family
of the Vrs̆ovici, and killed all whom they could seize&mdash;men,
women, and children. Some of them fled, to
Poland, and others to Hungary; and for a long time
the family was unknown in Bohemia. But this
savage act of vengeance did not produce the general
results at which its author had aimed. Svatopluk
himself was murdered during an invasion of Poland
by one of the exiled Vrs̆ovici; and the succeeding
reign was as much disturbed by family quarrels as
any which had preceded it.</p>

<p>But the real stability of Bohemia, and the substantial
unity which under-lay its divisions, were to
be proved very soon, by a most searching test. In
1125 the line of the Franconian sovereigns of Germany
ended; and Lothar, Duke of Saxony, was
chosen Emperor. It will be remembered that the
Saxons had now for some time been recognised as
the most dangerous rivals of Bohemia; and, at the
time of Lothar’s accession, an opportunity seemed to
offer itself for using the Imperial power to crush out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Bohemian independence. Sobeslav, the next Duke
of Bohemia, had just obtained the throne by the
influence of his mother Svatava, who had persuaded
the Bohemian nobles to ignore the claims of her
eldest son, Otto. Otto at once appealed to Lothar,
who asserted his right, as Emperor, to decide the
succession to the Dukedom of Bohemia.</p>

<p>Such a claim would have been resented at any
time; but Otto had specially offended Bohemian
feeling, by consenting to hold the province of Moravia
as a fief from the Emperor, instead of a dependency
of the Duke of Bohemia. All the national feeling
of independence at once burst into flame; Sobeslav
answered Lothar “that he trusted in the mercy of
God, and in the merits of the holy martyrs of Christ,
St. Wenceslaus, and St. Adalbert, that our country
would not be delivered into the hands of foreigners.”
Then he went round to the monasteries imploring
Divine help; and when he finally set out on his
march, the spear of St. Wenceslaus and the banner
of St. Adalbert were carried at the head of the army.
At the same time Sobeslav despatched a message
to the Emperor, reminding him that the Bohemian
nobles were the sole electors of their duke, and that
the Emperor had only the right of confirming their
choice. But Otto had filled the leaders of the Saxon
army with the belief that the nobles of Bohemia were
on their side; so the Emperor and his friends declared
that Sobeslav’s speech was mere raving.</p>

<p>Following Otto’s guidance, the Saxon army now
marched through a thick wood till they came to the
pass of Chlum. Here they found themselves wedged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in between two mountains, and so blocked by the
snow that they had to dismount from their horses.
While the invaders were thus cut off from any hope
of retreat, Sobeslav’s army broke in upon them from
three different sides. Surprised and unable to defend
themselves, the Saxons were cut to pieces; while many
of the Bohemians were encouraged by visions of St.
Wenceslaus and St. Adalbert. So great was the
victory that, in the words of one chronicler, “there
was rejoicing through all the family of St. Wenceslaus.”
Lothar admitted that he had been misled by
Otto, recognised the “judgment of God,” and presented
Sobeslav with the ducal standard.</p>

<p>Sobeslav, like all the wiser rulers of Bohemia, while
determined to maintain the independence of his
country, was unwilling to provoke any needless
quarrel with Germany. Even with Lothar he soon
entered into friendly relations; and, after the death
of the Saxon Emperor, he used his vote as Elector
of the Empire on behalf of Conrad of Hohenstauffen.
Once more the connection between Bohemia and the
Empire became one of close friendship; and Sobeslav
appealed to Conrad to confirm his nomination of his
son Vladislav as successor to the throne. Evidently
fearing the divisions which might follow his death,
Sobeslav further strengthened Vladislav’s position
by securing a special promise from the nobles and
knights that they would accept this prince as their
duke. The correctness of Sobeslav’s fears was soon
proved by the events which followed his death.
When in 1140 the duke was known to be dying, the
nobles of Bohemia met at the Vys̆ehrad, where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
consulted long about the succession to the throne;
and, though they finally decided to accept Vladislav
as their duke, he soon found that his tenure of
authority was a frail and uncertain one.</p>

<p>His difficulties, indeed, were much increased by the
reforming zeal of one of the most important of the
statesmen on whom he had to rely. Zdík, Bishop
of Olmütz, had just returned from a pilgrimage to
Palestine, full of eager enthusiasm for establishing
a new order of things. By this “new order” he
understood a revival of clerical discipline, an increase
of monasteries, and a stricter enforcement of general
purity of life. Vladislav sympathised with the
bishop’s zeal; and he had also enthusiasms of his
own, which were equally difficult of realisation. He
removed corrupt magistrates, and he insisted that his
subjects should have the right to appeal to him
against the decisions of those subordinate courts
which often represented rather the will of the lords
than the intentions of the law.</p>

<p>Such reforms, however welcome to the peasants,
the townsfolk, and the stricter clergy, were bitterly
opposed by the nobles, whose power they weakened,
and whose oppressions they redressed. Therefore,
in 1142, the nobles again met, to depose Vratislav
from the throne, and to choose a successor in his
place. After some discussion, they fixed upon Conrad,
the Margrave of Moravia, and placed him at the
head of the insurgent forces. Vladislav soon heard of
their intrigues; and, while he entrusted the Bishop
of Olmütz with the organisation of the ducal troops,
he himself sent messengers to the conspirators,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
reminding them of their oaths of allegiance; and he
specially appealed to his cousin Otto, the son of the
prince who had headed the Saxon invasion, reproaching
him with the fact that he had just restored
him to his father’s lands. But all these appeals were
in vain; the insurgent army advanced to “Vizoca,”
where they were encountered by Vladislav. The
fight was a fierce one, and many of the leading nobles
were killed; but at last, by pretending a panic, they
decoyed the ducal army into a dangerous position,
and there turned on them and routed them. Vladislav
retreated to Prague; and then, leaving his brother
Theobald to defend the city, he went to the Emperor
to ask his assistance. The Emperor remembered his
debt to Sobeslav, and willingly interceded for his
son; and Conrad of Moravia was soon compelled
to fly before the forces of his Imperial namesake.
Great part of the next four years was wasted in
compelling the insurgents to return to their allegiance;
but at last the Emperor succeeded in making
peace between the contending parties, and Conrad
was restored to the government of Moravia.</p>

<p>Vladislav now became eager to resume his interrupted
career of reform; and, as a first step, he began
to rebuild the monasteries which the rebels had destroyed.
Like Vratislav, however, he now felt himself
forced by the opposition which he had encountered
at home to rely more than ever on the German
Emperor; and he was thus dragged into expeditions
which had little concern for Bohemia. At first,
indeed, the wars in which he engaged were not of
a kind to offend the feelings of his countrymen. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
crusade, for instance, in which he followed Conrad in
1147, was too much in accordance with the ideas of
the time to provoke any open opposition from the
nobles; while his invasion of Poland in 1149 was,
doubtless, only too popular in Bohemia. But an
expedition of a far more important character, and
far more closely bound up with the Imperial power,
was, a few years later, to occupy the thoughts of
Vladislav and his countrymen.</p>

<p>In the year 1154 the Emperor Conrad died, and
the Electors of the Empire met to choose his successor.
The influence of the Duke of Bohemia in
these elections had now been completely recovered;
and Vladislav played a considerable part in securing
the success of his candidate, the son of Conrad,
the celebrated Barbarossa.</p>

<p>But Vladislav’s enemies were on the watch to
break a connection so important to his power.
Vladislav, for some reason not easy to ascertain,
refused to attend Barbarossa’s first Council at Merseburg.
This absence was at once seized upon by his
rival and kinsman Oldr̆ich to draw the Emperor’s
favour away from the new duke. Fortunately,
Vladislav, though absent, was well represented by
his shrewd adviser, Daniel, Bishop of Prague; and
by the bishop’s influence Oldr̆ich was quieted for
a time. Vladislav took note of this intrigue; and to
prevent its recurrence he drew closer his ties with
the Emperor, and consented to support the Emperor
in a new invasion of Poland.</p>

<p>This connection gave Barbarossa the opportunity
to interest Vladislav in his important projects for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
recovering and making firmer his position as Holy
Roman Emperor. The rising of Arnold of Brescia
had drawn the Pope and the Emperor for a time into
an alliance; and the appeal of Lodi against the
tyrannies of the greater Lombard towns had given
the Emperor a new excuse for establishing his rule
in Italy. So he became anxious to secure sufficient
support from the princes of the Empire; and he was
ready to grant favours to those most likely to be of
service to him. In 1156 he raised the Margravate
of Austria into an independent dukedom; and in the
following year he proposed to restore to Vladislav
that royal title which had gradually fallen into disuse
in Bohemia, on condition that the new King should
bring his forces to assist him in the siege of Milan.</p>

<p>This was the third occasion on which a royal crown
had been offered to the Dukes of Bohemia; and it
was in some ways the most significant of the three.
The first offer had been made to St. Wenceslaus, and
had been based entirely on the ground of his personal
qualities. The saint had refused it as inconsistent with
his character. The offer made to Vratislav had been
of a wholly different kind from the first proposal; but
the way in which the title speedily fell into disuse has
led some to doubt if Henry IV. had intended the
crown to be hereditary. In the case of Vladislav,
however, there was no doubt as to the intentions of
Barbarossa. Indeed, he clearly showed that he considered
the grant of this dignity as the revival of the
old Moravian kingship; and, in order to emphasise
the importance and independence of the new dignity,
he accompanied it by the grant of territory which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Bohemians had previously claimed, but over which
their rights had hitherto been disputed. Although,
therefore, the continual contests for the throne of
Bohemia, which followed the death of Vladislav,
made it impossible for the rival pretenders to make
good their claim to the royal title, there was, nevertheless,
no doubt that, from this time forth, any
lawfully elected ruler of Bohemia had the right
to call himself king. Yet, splendid as this proposal
was, Vladislav felt it necessary to consult his chief
adviser, Bishop Daniel of Prague, before he would
give the promise which could alone secure him the
new dignity. Daniel had no doubts in his own mind;
indeed, he seems throughout to have been more
zealous for the Imperial alliance than Vladislav
himself, and even to have taken a warm interest
in the details of the Italian campaign. He, therefore,
readily used his influence in favour of the proposal;
and the bargain between the Emperor and the King
was accordingly struck.</p>

<p>Few wise and well-meaning rulers have ever done
greater mischief to their country than Vladislav
accomplished by that hastily made bargain; but
nothing could be honester than his way of carrying
out the compact; and he clearly showed that he
believed himself to be acting for the good of his
country. He hastened back to Bohemia, and called
a General Council of the nobles, to whom he
announced the whole transaction. Immediately
fierce protests broke forth. The Duke, without
any consultation with his lawful advisers, had raised
himself to a new dignity, and had dragged the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
into a foreign war. The adviser of such unlawful acts
deserved to be crucified. This threat was obviously
aimed at Bishop Daniel, but Vladislav hastened to
take the whole responsibility upon himself. “I have
made this promise,” he said, “to the Emperor, by no
man’s advice, but of my own free will. I give this
answer to the honours which he has granted to me.
Whosoever intends to help me in this business, him
I will provide with fitting honour and with the money
necessary for this work; but he who cares not for it
let him sit at home content with the games and the
ease of women, and secure of the peace which I will
guarantee to him.”</p>

<p>It should be noted that, under the scornful rhetoric
of this speech, there is concealed the admission of
the important constitutional principle, that the king
had no right to demand the service of his subjects in
a foreign war. In saner moods and at later periods,
Bohemians were eager to assert this great liberty.
But, for the moment, the king’s appeal acted like
magic in silencing opposition and rousing enthusiasm
for the war. Songs were composed and speeches
delivered in honour of the siege of Milan; and,
while the young nobility disregarded the warnings
of their elders and hastened to take up arms in the
Imperial cause, the peasants gladly left their wearisome
occupations and oppressed condition to flock to the
banner of their beloved king. The splendid services
accomplished by Vladislav in that ill-fated war
strengthened his influence in the Councils of the
Empire; and it is at least pleasant to mention that,
at the siege of Brescia, the King of Bohemia used his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
influence with Barbarossa to soften the terms offered
to the unfortunate Brescians. His personal share in
the war was indeed cut short, partly by ill-health,
partly by the necessity of returning to Bohemia,
which was disturbed by the insurrection of a new
pretender. But his son Frederick and his brother
Theobald brought new reinforcements to the camp
of Barbarossa; and a large part of all the glory
that could be won in such a cause was due to the
Bohemian soldiers.</p>

<p>Nor was Vladislav less successful in rousing the
enthusiasm of his subjects in favour of another war,
which had as little connection as the Italian expedition
had had with the welfare of Bohemia. Queen Geysa,
of Hungary, appealed to Vladislav in 1164 to help
her young son in his struggle against a pretender
to the Hungarian throne. Again Vladislav promised
his help, and again the constitutional protest against
his promise produced an explanation which served to
show the deference of the king to the laws, while its
complete success proved his personal popularity in the
country. This campaign gave additional proof of
the king’s military reputation; for the Emperor of
Constantinople, who had invaded Hungary on behalf
of the rebels, was eager to make a special peace with
his Bohemian opponent; and when he failed to effect
this purpose, he speedily returned to his own country
and accepted the proposals of Vladislav about the
terms of his peace with Queen Geysa.</p>

<p>The reign of Vladislav stands out strangely in the
middle of the disorderly twelfth century. We see
there a king suppressing disorder without suppressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
freedom; armed insurrection by selfish intriguers,
changing as if by magic into constitutional opposition
on behalf of most important liberties; and all these
gains apparently connected with an increase in military
glory and national prestige, such as might well dazzle
even men of some sagacity and foresight.</p>

<p>But the glory, and, what was of far more importance,
the peace of Bohemia, were of short duration. The
death of Bishop Daniel broke the chief link between
Vladislav and Barbarossa. The bishop had remained
with the Emperor during his Italian campaign; his
counsels had always been welcome, and his influence
had, no doubt, been a strong force in securing Bohemia
to the Imperial cause. Nor did his death produce
a merely negative effect on the relations between
Bohemia and the Empire. It brought into play
another influence which was exerted on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>Vladislav’s queen, Judith, favoured the party of
Pope Alexander III.; and by her advice a Saxon
bishop, who had taken the Papal side, was elected
as Daniel’s successor. As the new bishop was totally
ignorant of the Bohemian language, his election
weakened Vladislav’s popularity with his people as
much as his favour with the Emperor. Three years
later, the enemies of the king once more found their
opportunity to make use of these discontents against
him. Vladislav, without any consultation with the
nobles, and without any notice to the Emperor, resigned
his power to his son Frederick; and the intriguers,
whom he had with such difficulty suppressed, were
now easily able to rouse an insurrection against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
his successor. Then followed twenty-five years of
miserable dynastic squabbles, during which Conrad
of Moravia was able to play the part of king-maker,
and, by the help of the puppets whom he placed on
the throne of Bohemia, to secure a temporary independence
for the province which he governed.</p>

<p>At last the contest was brought to an end by the
accession of King Pr̆emysl to the throne in 1198; and
he settled the question of Moravian government by
conceding the rule of that province to his brother
Vladislav. Pr̆emysl came at the right moment to
recover for Bohemia the power and influence of
which the civil wars of a quarter of a century had
deprived her. Once more, as in the time of Henry
IV., Germany’s difficulty was Bohemia’s opportunity.
The death of Henry VI., the son of
Barbarossa, had thrown the Empire into all the disorder
which arises from a disputed succession; and
Pr̆emysl found his interest in playing off one rival
emperor against another, just as the Emperors had
previously played with the rival candidates to the
Bohemian throne. Philip and Otto soon found that
their respective causes were practically at the mercy
of the Bohemian king; and, if Dubravsky has any
authority for saying that Pr̆emysl’s surname of
Ottakar was a tribute to his devotion to Otto,
never, certainly, did a nickname convey keener
irony.</p>

<p>Nor did the election of Frederick II. diminish the
power of Pr̆emysl. His influence had considerably
contributed to that election; and Frederick’s lifelong
war against popes and priests compelled him to rely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
on any friend who would stand by him against those
dangerous antagonists. In his eagerness to secure
Pr̆emysl’s help, the Emperor confirmed to the
Bohemian crown those German territories in Silesia
and the Lausitz, which had so long been the subject
of dispute. He also granted to Pr̆emysl the power of
appointing bishops in Bohemia without any outside
interference. Pr̆emysl’s sympathies with Frederick
were further quickened by the struggles with the
clergy of Bohemia in which he found himself involved.
The same difficulties which our Henry II.
had so recently experienced, in his attempts to
bring the clergy under the authority of lay tribunals,
were harassing Pr̆emysl during a large part of his
reign; and his attitude in these matters provoked
against him Papal censures as stern as those which
were aimed at his Imperial ally. The contest
between king and priest in Bohemia ended in a
compromise; but the substantial victory probably
remained with the king.</p>

<p>Pr̆emysl’s vigour tended, no doubt, to reconcile the
discontented nobles to his rule; but, in the reign of
his son Wenceslaus, the opposition again began to
make head. Young Pr̆emysl Ottakar, the son of
Wenceslaus, had been appointed Margrave of
Moravia; and the power connected with this office
induced the nobles to make the young prince the
centre of their intrigues. The terrible events of
1241 suppressed faction for a time in Bohemia;
for in that year the invasion of Genghis Khan
shook all the States of Europe to their centre, and
gradually forced into the background any minor cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of division. The details of this invasion are more
properly connected with the events to be dealt with
in the following chapter. Here it is enough to say
that the panic produced by this invasion enabled
Wenceslaus to rally round him the whole forces of
the kingdom, and to establish the reputation of
Bohemia as the champion of European civilisation.</p>

<p>But there was one ruler, in whom neither fear of
danger nor gratitude for deliverance could quench
his hostility to the Slavonic kingdom. This was
Frederick of Babenberg, Duke of Austria, who was
otherwise known as Frederick the Quarrelsome.
Ever since the time when Vratislav had defeated
the Margrave Leopold in his rising against Henry
IV., the rulers of Austria had been doubtful
friends to Bohemia; and, though accident might
sometimes have forced them into an alliance, their
ordinary attitude was that of suspicion, if not of
open hostility. Frederick the Quarrelsome was one
of the bitterest in his opposition. He invaded Moravia
in the very year after the repulse of the Mongols; and
he continued the struggle till his death.</p>

<p>That death, however, instead of bringing peace to
Wenceslaus, only raised against him a far more
formidable opponent. The Emperor Frederick had
opposed the efforts of his turbulent namesake; but,
when the Duke died without an heir, it seemed an
excellent opportunity for seizing Austria as a fief of
the Empire. Wenceslaus, on the other hand, desired
to secure the dukedom for his son Vladislav; and, in
spite of Imperial opposition, he seems to have won for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
his son the sympathies, of a part, at least, of the
Austrian nobles.</p>

<p>Thus then ended abruptly that alliance between
Bohemia and the Empire which had been so useful
to both parties. Neither Wenceslaus nor Frederick
lost time in their declarations of hostility to each
other. In 1247 Wenceslaus openly joined in the
schemes of Innocent IV., for deposing the
Emperor, and setting up William of Holland in
his place; and Frederick revenged himself by stirring
up the discontented Bohemian nobles against their
king. The struggle was a sharp one; the rebels
succeeded for a time in deposing Wenceslaus and
setting up young Ottakar in his stead; but the
threats of Innocent IV. brought them back to
their allegiance; and a compromise by which young
Ottakar was confirmed in his former government of
Moravia removed him from the ranks of his father’s
enemies. The death of Frederick II. once more
plunged the Empire into disorder. Wenceslaus saw
his opportunity in this confusion; and, as Vladislav
was now dead, the King persuaded young Ottakar to
seize the dukedom of Austria for himself. The
Austrians accepted their new duke without any
apparent reluctance; and thus, when Wenceslaus
died in 1253, Ottakar II. became king of a Bohemia,
which included not only Silesia and the Lausitz, but
also the dukedom of Austria.</p>

<p>In the present century the development of national

This interest has arisen partly from the spectacle of
the unusual number of new experiments in government
which have been made in our own time; partly
from the growing sense that the history of wars and
Courts has become less important, and that the growth
of law and of popular life ought to take the place of
those exploded subjects of interest. But the exact
legal position of the different component parts of a
nation is not generally easy to ascertain at an early
period of its history; nor, when it is ascertained, has
the knowledge always brought us nearer to the discovery
of the really living and progressive force in
the nation at that period.</p>

<p>Thus, in the case of Bohemia, though we get continual
hints of national feeling and popular aspiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
these do not always centre in legally constituted
bodies, nor do they keep pace with any orderly line
of constitutional development. Assemblies seem constantly
to have met, but these were, in the main,
assemblies of nobles; and the general national feeling
more often took the form of an enthusiasm for the
Bohemian language, or the reverence for a native saint,
than of a demand for the extension of the rights of
any class, or for a limitation of the royal power.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a natural consequence of this popular
indifference to political progress, as compared with the
zeal for the preservation of the national language, and
the religious ritual, that, by the close of the twelfth
century, we find few traces remaining of those free
institutions which seemed to connect themselves with
the story of Libus̆a. Even those securities for popular
freedom, which undoubtedly prevailed in historical
times, had been, in the course of the eleventh and
twelfth centuries, corrupted into new sources of
tyranny. Of these the most important had been the
Z̆upa, or local assembly. This had been formed
partly for purposes of self-defence, partly for ecclesiastical
organisation; and, though it had centred at
one time in a castle, at another in a church, yet it had
originally been governed by a judge, elected by the
district.</p>

<p>But from the time of Boleslav the Cruel, the Dukes
began to make it their practice to grant these local
judgeships to nobles who had done them special
service; and those nobles were generally allowed
either to sell their offices or to bequeath them to
their heirs. The temptation to use this position as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
an instrument of oppression was yet further increased
by the profit which the judges were allowed to make
out of the fines that they had inflicted. The money
thus accumulated was often used for the purchase of
neighbouring lands; and thus lands formerly held by
freemen, or on the communal system, passed into the
power of the official nobles. In the meantime those
nobles, who did not become Z̆upani, were able to profit
by the growing unpopularity of the local tribunals to
strengthen the power of their own feudal courts over
their dependants; while the continual wars, and the
practice of selling captives into slavery, encouraged
the growth of an even more helpless and degraded
class. The coolness with which many of the grants
of land transfer workmen of various kinds as mere
appendages of fields and fishponds, is in itself a proof
of the degraded position to which the peasant class
in Bohemia had been reduced; and the fact that
military service seemed one of the few means of
escaping from serfdom led the peasants to favour
those wars which in the end increased their misery.</p>

<p>When the peculiarly disturbed state of Bohemia,
which followed King Vladislav’s retirement from
power, had been for a time brought to an end, or at
least modified by the accession of Pr̆emysl Ottakar
to the throne of the kingdom, it became necessary to
provide some remedy for the miserable state of things
which was destroying the country; and above all to
find a new opportunity for the development of peaceful
trade, and some power which could counteract the
lawless intrigues of the nobles. The calling into life
of communities which should be out of reach of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
power both of feudalism and officialism was the natural
method of meeting these difficulties; and, in the ruin
of the rest of the country, there seemed to be two
places where there still lingered traditions that could
be made available for this purpose.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, amid the decay of national freedom,
the privileges granted to foreigners still remained
undiminished; and, stranger still, it was from these
communities that a new material for national life was
to be drawn. In the district of Poric̆, which Vratislav
had raised into a suburb of Prague, a settlement of
German workmen had been planted by that king;
and to encourage them in the continuance of their
occupations, he had granted them rights of self-government,
which had survived the freedom of the
Z̆upani, and the other elements of independence which
had been enjoyed by the poorer classes of Bohemia.
They had been allowed to choose their own judge
without interference from any one; and, except in the
cases of the most extreme crimes, which were dealt
with by the Duke himself, they were allowed to carry
on their own affairs according to their own laws.
They were never to be compelled to go on military
service, except when the actual defence of the country
required it. A Bohemian wishing to bring an action
against a German was obliged to prove his case
through two German witnesses and one Bohemian
before a German judge. They were to be safe from
that compulsory intrusion into their houses by nobles
who came from a distance, which was one of the great
burdens of the Bohemian citizens; and in many other
matters they were allowed to follow the customs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
their own country. The respect felt for these privileges
is sufficiently shown by the fact that, even in the time
of turbulence and disorder between the abdication of
Vladislav, and the accession of Pr̆emysl, we find a
formal confirmation by Duke Sobeslav of Vratislav’s
grant to the settlers in Poric̆.</p>

<p>Here then Pr̆emysl could find a tradition which
might justify him in developing, without violent
change, liberties of the greatest importance to his
country; and accordingly in 1213 he grants to the
citizens of Freudenthal the settlement of their town
“in accordance with that Teutonic law which has
hitherto been unwonted and unused in the lands of
Bohemia and Moravia; but which, having been
granted to you first by our illustrious brother
Vladislav, Margrave of Moravia, we confirm with
our royal authority.” And then, as an important
hint of coming developments, and an indication of
the thoroughly national purpose of this movement,
he grants them, during the life of himself and his
brother, the tithes on the metals found within four
miles from the city, to be used for the improvement
of the aforesaid city.</p>

<p>But, if the new development of town life took root
at this time in the western parts of Bohemia, it seems
to have had a still earlier growth in the more eastern
province of Moravia. That province had always had
peculiar traditions of its own. It was a fragment of
the old kingdom of Moravia, and had been incorporated
in the Bohemian dukedom, at the time of the
Hungarian invasion. It always retained a sense of
its important position; and Barbarossa himself had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
increased that feeling when, in granting the royal
crown to Vladislav, he spoke of the new dignity as a
revival of the old Moravian kingdom. Moreover, by
some means or other, a German element seems to have
penetrated into this province; and it is now generally
believed that in Moravia, as in Bohemia, the first
traditions of municipal self-government were drawn
from German sources. Nevertheless, when in 1229
King Pr̆emysl recognised the municipal liberties of
Brünn (Brno), he evidently refers to them as connected
with local rights which had been traditional
for a considerable time in that town; and in the book
of decisions of the Moravian municipal tribunals, the
Law of Brno is sometimes pitted against that Law
of Magdeburg which was generally accepted as the
model of town rights. Brünn, too, became in a
peculiar manner the centre of the towns of Moravia,
and its laws became a new source of life to a great
portion of the Bohemian kingdom; and its Book of
Rights, with its splendid binding and beautiful illuminations,
may still be seen in the town council house
at Brünn. So, when in 1229 Pr̆emysl Ottakar confirmed
the ancient laws of the province of Brünn, he
gave a new, and probably more attractive, impulse to
the movement for civic self-government.</p>

<p class="caption">RADNICE BRNE: OLD DOOR OF TOWN COUNCIL HOUSE OF BRÜNN.</p>

</div>

<p>These rights, however, were of gradual growth, and
at the time of Pr̆emysl’s decree they were not developed
to that point which the subsequent records of
their interpretation would lead one to expect. Thus,
although we find securities against arbitrary arrest,
we do not find that definite arrangement for the
production of legal witnesses which was afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
established; and, though the judge is no longer
allowed to decide questions alone, the check upon
him seems to be rather that of officials and nobles
than of his fellow-citizens. But, whatever defects
and limitations we may find in these early provisions
for municipal liberty, the movement in its favour was
soon to be hastened by one of the most tremendous
shocks which had convulsed Europe since the fall of
the Roman Empire. This was nothing less than the
invasion of Genghis Khan and his Tartar hordes,
which has already been slightly alluded to in the
previous chapter.</p>

<p>It appears that the Cumani, a still barbarous tribe,
had come into collision with the Tartars in Asia;
and, either flying from Tartar vengeance, or following
a new career of conquest, the Cumani entered
Hungary. There they joined with some of their
kinsmen who had formerly settled there, and began
to harass the Hungarians. The Tartars quickly
followed on their heels; and, having overrun Russia,
they made their way into Hungary, defeated King
Bela, and laid waste his territory, killing men, women,
and children. From thence they swept over Poland,
and advanced into Moravia, while others attacked
Bulgaria and Greece. The terror-struck descriptions
of the writers of the period seem to combine the
memories of Gothic and Hunnish invasions with the
imagery of the Apocalypse. Like so many conquerors,
Genghis Khan seems to have had a conception
of a special mission to destroy imposed on him
by some invisible Power; and he and his followers
were looked on, for a time, as irresistible. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
twelve thousand men wearing breastplates of skin,
and always on horseback, and twenty or thirty horses
without any one to guide them following every rider;
for the Mongol Tartars could do nothing on foot
because of their short legs and long bodies. They
were killing all except those children whom Genghis
Khan was branding on the face with his mark. Their
women were said to fight on horseback; and those
who slaughtered the most were the most admired.</p>

<p>While Europe was panic-struck, and every man
was calling on his neighbour for help, Pope Gregory
IX. and the Emperor Frederick II. were fighting
with each other for the possession of Sicily; and,
while Frederick pleaded that he could not put
himself at the head of the Imperial forces till
Gregory would let him alone, the friends and
admirers of Gregory were accusing Frederick of
having himself invited in the Tartars; and some
even declared that they had seen his messengers in
the Tartar army. Alone almost among the princes
of Europe, Wenceslaus of Bohemia, who had now
succeeded to the throne, seems to have preserved
some nerve and sense. He called upon the Duke
of Austria, the Patriarch of Aquileia, the Duke of
Carinthia, and the Margrave of Baden to help him
to gather together his forces near Olmütz (Olomouci);
and he made so determined a stand that the invasion
was rolled back upon Hungary.</p>

<p>Even after this defeat of the Tartars the terror of
them hung for years over Europe; but, though
Bohemia itself was not yet free from danger,
Wenceslaus, as King of Bohemia, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Pr̆emysl Ottakar, as Margrave of Moravia, now set
themselves to redress the injuries done by the Tartar
invasion. In 1243 they began to enlarge and restore
the towns which had been destroyed by the Tartars;
and in order to induce the frightened citizens to
devote themselves to this work, they found it necessary
to encourage them by the grant of further
liberties.</p>

<p>The conception of municipal government evidently
makes great strides at this time. Accused persons
are now more carefully guarded from arbitrary
sentences; and we also find the jury rising to an
equality with the judge in the decision of certain
matters. More clearly, too, do we detect the determination
to put a check on the tyranny of the nobles
by the development of civic liberties. “We will,”
says Wenceslaus, in his extension of the privileges of
Brünn, “and we irrefragably decree that no baron or
noble of the land shall have power in the city of
Brünn, or shall do any violence in it, or shall detain
any one, without the license and proclamation of the
judge of the city; and we will that, whoever of the
citizens has servants or possessions outside the city,
shall not be summoned by the provincial judge, or
the officials of the province, but shall be judged by
the judge of the city.”</p>

<p class="caption">JÍHLAVA (IGLAU), THE GREAT MINING CENTRE IN MORAVIA.</p>

</div>

<p>The power of demising property without interference
from others, freedom of marriage or non-marriage
to widows and maidens, various forms of
protection against violence, facilities for holding
markets, and the removal of customs duties&mdash;such
are the chief subjects dealt with in these civic constitutions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The discovery and working of minerals,
which largely date from this time, led to new
opportunities of self-government. In the town of
Iglau (Jíhlava), where miners had been prominent in
the defence of their country against the Tartars,
the powers granted to them and the neighbouring
citizens were particularly large. “We wish and
command,” say Wenceslaus and Pr̆emysl Ottakar
his son, “that, whatever the jury of our city and the
jury of the miners have ordained, for the commercial
good, should be inviolably observed by all.” Even
tax-collectors of the king are to consult the miners
in certain matters; while special securities are given
against possible defalcations by debtors of noble
birth.</p>

<p>Great as was the advance which is implied in
these decrees, the use made of them by the citizens
shows that they understood how to extend their
liberties still further. The benefit derived from the
powers granted to civic judges might have been
neutralised by the way in which the judgeships were
still conferred by the kings on their personal
favourites; but the jurymen of Brünn claimed for
themselves the power of checking, and even overruling
the judge, which must have been a far better
guarantee for the self-government of the city than
any that was directly contained in the royal decree.</p>

<p>“The judge,” say these administrators, “must
reverence the jury as legislators, never dictate
sentences on his own authority, never arrest any
one without their knowledge, never appropriate to
himself the fines of the city, never bring back those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that are driven from the city, without the consent of
the jurors; always listen to them, and arrange all
the business of his office according to their advice.”</p>

<p>How much the sense of equality before the law
grew under this administration may be illustrated by
the following instance. A servant has brought an
action against a fellow-servant for wounding him;
while at the same time a master brings an action
against the same defendant for debt. The question
arises which of these shall be heard first. The jury
decide that “since the body of a man is more
precious than money,” the defendant should answer
for his violence to the man whom he has wounded,
before he answers to the master for his debt. More
bold still was the assertion of the rights of the
citizens to hold the nobles responsible to the city
tribunals for lands held within the city. And while
they held their own against the nobles outside, the
popular magistrates increased their authority within
the city. The power of regulating trade, which in
England was seized by the Guilds, was, in the
Moravian towns, at once taken into the hands of the
civic authorities; and thus those conflicts, which Mrs.
Green has described as prevailing in so many English
towns, between the magistrates and the leaders of the
trades, never assume such prominence in the history
of Brünn and Olmütz.</p>

<p>Nor was it only in their immediate security for
liberty and good government that these civic rights
were of advantage to Bohemia and Moravia. Questions
were forced upon the practical consideration of
the jurors, the very discussion of which formed an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
important element in political education. Thus the
treatment by the jurors of the questions of the value
of torture, and ordeal by battle, as methods of
discovering truth, show how experience was already
preparing the way for the overthrow of abuses, which
were yet too strongly supported by popular prejudice
to be removed at once. The steady growth of these
liberties, which had received so powerful an impulse
from the needs produced by the Tartar invasion, was
still further promoted by Pr̆emysl Ottakar II., and
became in his hands part of a complete scheme for
humbling the power of the nobility.</p>

<p>Wenceslaus, in spite of some fine qualities, had
been a self-indulgent and pleasure-seeking man; and
he had, like some of his predecessors, mortgaged
many of the royal lands and castles to the nobles.
This had naturally increased their power, and had
enabled them to organise those insurrections against
the king in which they had at first succeeded in
involving his son. But even while he was still
Margrave of Moravia, young Pr̆emysl Ottakar had
broken loose from these influences; and by various
economies and convenient pecuniary transactions he
had succeeded in raising money enough to purchase
back the lands from the nobles, compelling them,
sometimes against their will, to surrender their
mortgages. He also forced them to break down
those castles which had been great causes of disorder
and weakness in the country. Nor did he fail to
strengthen his cause by alliance with the clergy.</p>

<p>Ever since the quarrel between Frederick II. and
Wenceslaus, that King had been a devoted champion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of the Pope; and in the growing weakness of the
Empire, the Pope became more and more the one
great Power to which a rising and ambitious king
could appeal. Ottakar II. became distinguished as
a friend of the Church, not only by his strong
support of the Papal power, but by his endowment
and development of the monasteries. In this, indeed,
he was carrying on that revival of Bohemian life
which Wenceslaus had begun after the repulse of the
Tartars. But it was evident that these ecclesiastical
exemptions must sometimes come into collision with
those civic liberties of which we have spoken.</p>

<p>This contradiction was evidently felt by Ottakar;
and it showed itself in three different ways. The
freedom of trade, which, under certain limitations,
was so welcome to the towns, was by no means in
accordance with the claims of the abbots. They
wished that certain occupations should be carried on
under their control; and not that there should be
any exchange of the articles connected with those
occupations. Thus we find in some of the grants to
the monasteries that, while the monks and their
dependants are relieved from certain forms of taxation,
the exemption is specially limited to those who
are not engaged in trade. Secondly, there was an
obvious risk of a conflict of authority between the
monastic tribunals and those of the city. Thirdly,
the records of Brünn, and of its imitators, show that
the growing ideas of equality before the law did not
always seem to the citizens quite consistent with the
privileges claimed by the clergy. Nor must it be
supposed that charters to monasteries and charters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to towns represented, in the same degree, the ordinary
idea of human liberty. The dependants of the
abbot were as much at his mercy as those of any
feudal lord; and though it might be an advantage
for them to escape from the oppressions of the
Z̆upani, it was not always certain that the abbot
would be a gentler master.</p>

<p>That Ottakar felt the difficulty of this conflict, and
desired to compromise between the interests of these
rivals for his favour, is strikingly illustrated by the
two cases of Hradiste and Litomys̆l. In the former
case, Ottakar was particularly anxious to secure the
good will of the citizens, because he looked upon
their town as a possible bulwark against Hungarian
invasion; but the neighbouring convent of Vilegrad
feared that the grant of liberties to Hradiste would
interfere with the privileges of their convent. The
compromise to which Ottakar was forced seems a
considerable surrender to ecclesiastical pretensions.
The townsmen were to settle in one particular island,
for which they were to pay rent to the monastery.
The monastery was to retain all its former rights
over waters, fisheries, mills, meadows, woods, and
corn-fields; and, though the town was to hold a
market two days a week, the profit of that market
was to go on one day to the king, and on another to
the monastery; and, above all, the judge of the town
was to be appointed by the monastery. But in this
decree there is a provision which seems to suggest
how even such a compromise might work for freedom.
The common rights in pasture held previously by the
townsmen are to be shared with the dependants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the monastery; but the dependants of the monastery
in their turn are to share their common rights with
the citizens of the town. Thus there would naturally
grow up a combination among the dependants of the
monasteries, like those unions which, in England,
gave such trouble to the abbots of St. Albans and
Dunstable.</p>

<p>In the case of Litomys̆l the grants to the monastery
and those given to the town are so entangled
that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between
the benefits received by the respective recipients of
the royal favour; and, in this case, Ottakar seems to
have cut the knot by raising Litomys̆l to the ordinary
position of a royal town, and thereby emancipating it
from the control of the monastery. Ottakar indeed
had one sure protection against any possible offence
which the Church might fear from the growth of
civic liberty. Bruno, Bishop of Olmütz, was his right-hand
man in this as in other parts of his work. Himself
a German by birth, he warmly encouraged the
introduction of German town rights into the cities of
Moravia; while, on the other hand, he always succeeded,
until the final catastrophe of Ottakar’s life, in
strengthening the good understanding between the
Pope and the King of Bohemia.</p>

<p>Thus there were now growing up in Bohemia the
elements of internal liberty, under the patronage of a
king strong and wise enough to hold his own against
the nobles. Had Ottakar been content to remain
King of Bohemia alone, the effect of his reign on his
country might have been permanently beneficial.
But it is now necessary to speak of that career of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
conquest and aggression which raised up against him
so many enemies, and which at last put into the
hands of his most dangerous rival the weapon by
which king and country were alike overthrown.</p>

<p>However evil were the final results of his aggressions,
it must be owned that there was a certain
plausibility in the justification offered by Ottakar
for each of his conquests. To begin with the first
and most important of them, the conquest of Austria.
The Babenbergers had been undoubtedly troublesome
neighbours to the Dukes of Bohemia; and Frederick
the Quarrelsome, the last of the line, had been also
so oppressive to his subjects that they had appealed
to the Emperor to choose them a new duke. On this
occasion the King of Bohemia had been one of those
to whom the enforcement of the ban of the Empire
had been entrusted. When, then, on the death of
Frederick the Quarrelsome, the land seemed likely to
fall into the hands of the Emperor, or to be torn in
pieces by rival claimants, Wenceslaus and Ottakar
may have naturally considered it a matter of self-defence
to establish their rule, and with it some
kind of order, in the lands of so near a neighbour;
and they were further encouraged in their attempt by
the approval of Pope Innocent IV.</p>

<p>But the latter phases of the conquest are perhaps
less excusable, and even somewhat discreditable to
Wenceslaus and his son. The Austrian nobles, on
the death of the Emperor Frederick had resolved to
choose the Margrave of Meissen as their duke, and
to send representatives to invite him to accept the
ducal crown. On their way through Bohemia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Wenceslaus invited them to a banquet, and tried to
cajole them into choosing his son as their duke. The
messengers, alarmed and taken by surprise, declared
that they had no authority to accept this proposal.
Wenceslaus, thereupon, uttered such threats, that the
Austrians considered it dangerous to continue their
journey; and they returned to their country to reconsider
the question.</p>

<p>Apart from the claim given to the Margrave of
Meissen by the choice of the nobles, there were two
rival claimants to the dukedom of Austria; Margaret
the widow of the Emperor Henry VI., and daughter
of Leopold the Glorious, the most popular of all the
Babenberg House; and Gertrude a niece of Frederick
the Quarrelsome, and wife of the Margrave of Baden.
Margaret was, of course, tolerably advanced in life,
and had taken a vow of virginity after the death of
her husband; but Wenceslaus and Bruno of Olmütz
persuaded young Ottakar to make good his claim to
the duchy by wooing the widow. In an evil hour
for herself, Margaret consented to Ottakar’s proposal;
the approval of the Pope, and possibly some slight
display of military force, completed Ottakar’s claim;
and he was accepted by some at least of the Austrian
nobles as their Duke.</p>

<p>In Austria, as in Bohemia, Ottakar looked chiefly
for his support to the great cities. Vienna flourished
under his rule; and he granted special privileges to
the neighbouring town of Neustadt. But the hostility
of the nobles still continued; and they were resolved
that, at all events, the German province of Styria
should not fall into Bohemian hands. The difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of Ottakar’s position on this question lay in the fact
that the most important rival claimant was Bela,
King of Hungary, who, like Ottakar, was a special
favourite of the Pope; and in the beginning of the
struggle the King of Hungary succeeded in establishing
his authority in Styria. But, by the admission
even of Ottakar’s enemies, the tyranny of the
Hungarians in Styria was so great that, when
Ottakar again made an attempt on the province, he
was welcomed as a deliverer; and for the time he
made good his footing.</p>

<p>It was now necessary to get a formal sanction for
these conquests; and Ottakar chose Richard of
Cornwall, from the rival claimants to the German
Empire, as the puppet most useful for this purpose.
Richard was willing enough to secure so influential a
supporter; but the King of Hungary was not so
easily satisfied. In 1260, he once more poured his
forces into Styria and Austria; and he was now
followed, not only by the Hungarian troops, but by
the savage Cumanians, and even, according to one
account, by the Tartars. The struggle was a fierce
one; but it ended in the complete victory of the
Bohemians.</p>

<p>Ottakar, however, thought it necessary to secure
himself against future invasions, by a singularly
questionable step. The unfortunate Margaret, to
whom, it was evident, he must very soon have become
unfaithful, was to be repudiated on the ground of her
former vow of virginity, in order that Ottakar might
marry Kunigunda, the daughter of Bela, King of
Hungary. Urban IV., like many of his predecessors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
was extremely desirous to procure a good understanding
between Hungary and Bohemia, as in the
union of these kingdoms he saw the best hope of
security against a future Tartar invasion; so Kunigunda
was crowned Queen of Bohemia by the Archbishop
of Mainz.</p>

<p>But Ottakar’s conquests were not yet at an end.
Ulrich, the Duke of Carinthia and Carniola, had a
very troublesome brother called Philip, who was
generally at feud with some prince or other. Amongst
his other enemies was the Patriarch of Aquileia, to
whose office he desired to succeed. Ulrich, knowing
Ottakar’s influence with the Pope and the ecclesiastics
generally, tried to secure that influence in favour of
the election of Philip to the patriarchate. Ottakar
agreed, on condition that Ulrich would make him his
heir in Carinthia and Carniola. Ulrich consented to
this proposal; and, by Ottakar’s influence, the
Chapter of Aquileia elected Philip Patriarch.
Philip was apparently unaware of the bargain; and
he was therefore extremely indignant, when, on
Ulrich’s death, the King of Bohemia entered Carinthia
and Carniola as the lawful heir of Ulrich. This
bitterness was further increased when the Pope
refused to confirm the election of the Chapter, and
Philip found himself without either patriarchate or
dukedom.</p>

<p>Ottakar was now the lord of all the territories
which form the western part of the present Austrian
Empire, with the exception of the Tyrol. But his
hold on these conquered territories was by no means
so certain as it at first appeared. Though none of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
his rivals were able, at the moment, to make good
their claims against him, yet any one of them might
reckon on a formidable amount of discontent in all
the conquered provinces. For the same policy which
he had pursued in Bohemia of breaking down the
power of the nobles, by destroying their castles, was
carried on in his new dominions; and, while in all of
them it caused considerable opposition, in Styria the
discontent soon ripened into rebellion.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Styrian nobles had, from the
first, been one of more determined hostility than
Ottakar had encountered in his other dominions;
and it soon provoked him into measures which increased
the evil. One can scarcely accept as undoubted
history all the charges of cruelty made against him
by the Styrian noble Ottakar von Horneck, who was
evidently in full sympathy from the first with those
who resisted the Bohemian claims. Still less can we
accept as authentic the reckless attacks of the chronicler
Victor, who was a chaplain of the House of
Hapsburg. But those facts, which seem to be indisputable,
are sufficient of themselves to account for
Ottakar’s failure to reduce the province to submission.
As usual in such cases, intriguers were found to
intensify the king’s suspicions by false accusations;
some nobles were thrown into prison on insufficient
evidence; and when the case broke down against
them, their accuser was in turn imprisoned. Finally,
Milota, the governor appointed by Ottakar, tried to
bring in Bohemian soldiers and Bohemian settlers to
maintain the authority of the king.</p>

<p>But, though all these elements of discontent were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
gradually ripening to violent conclusions, to outward
appearance Ottakar was still at the height of his
power. Old King Bela of Hungary, in dying, placed
his wife, daughter, and barons under the special protection
of Ottakar; and, when Bela’s son and successor
Stephen tried to shake off the power which his father
had given to Bohemia, he found himself opposed by
the bishops and archbishops of Hungary, and by
some even of the barons. Ottakar was able to dictate
peace in Hungary itself, and Stephen was forced
to renounce all claims to Styria and Carinthia.</p>

<p>A change, however, was shortly to occur in Europe
which was to diminish one of the chief causes of
Ottakar’s success. In his, as in former reigns, Germany’s
difficulty had been Bohemia’s opportunity;
and it was Ottakar’s too ready recognition of this fact
which now brought him into collision with the wisest
and most patriotic rulers in Europe, as well as with
some of the most daring intriguers. Ever since the
death of Henry VI., the son of Barbarossa, the
claim to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire had
been perpetually disputed. The striking and romantic
figure of Frederick II. had indeed arrested the
attention of Europe in a marked manner; but the
intense hatred felt for him by all the Popes, his
own preference of Sicily to Germany, and the complete
disorganisation produced by the Tartar invasion,
had combined to prevent him from establishing any
firm rule in the Empire. Since his death the phantom
figures of William of Holland, Conrad the Fourth,
Alfonso of Castille, and Richard of Cornwall had
flitted across the stage of German politics, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
contributing a certain amount of increase to the general
anarchy. In the absence of any settled central
government, the great towns of Germany had endeavoured
to form leagues for their own protection,
and in the general interest of order; but even these
had a difficulty in maintaining their existence against
the pretensions of the archbishops and the robberies
of the knights and nobles.</p>

<p>In such a state of things the first instinct of those
who desired to restore order was to choose the
strongest ruler who could be found; and therefore
it was not altogether surprising that the Imperial
crown was offered, by some at least of the German
princes, to Ottakar himself. The grounds of Ottakar’s
refusal have been variously given; and it is highly
probable that both of the explanations offered were
parts of the truth. On the one hand his nobles,
already jealous of his power, were extremely unwilling
that he should have a new and independent
force at his back, which would enable him still further
to overawe them; while, on the other hand, Ottakar
himself saw clearly that the position of King of
Bohemia and King-maker of the Empire was a far
safer and more powerful one than the position of a
Holy Roman Emperor, checked, and often controlled,
by the Electors of the Empire.</p>

<p>The Elector who took the most prominent part in
this offer to Ottakar had been the Archbishop of
Köln; but Werner of Mainz now succeeded in inducing
the Archbishops of Köln and Trier to join him
in an alliance which was to secure the election of
an Emperor who would be amenable to their advice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Werner had been specially alarmed at the growth of
Ottakar’s power; for any development of Bohemian
independence would weaken the power of the Empire
over the diocese of Prague, and would thereby weaken
also the ecclesiastical authority of Mainz. He was,
therefore, specially anxious to secure a counterbalancing
power to Ottakar’s, but a power which
would at the same time be dependent on the
Electors of the Empire. The Archbishops first considered,
and then rejected, the proposal to raise to the
Imperial throne the Count Palatine of the Rhine; for
they soon saw that he might be useful as an ally, but
extremely dangerous as a master. As the great
hindrance to the unity of the Empire seemed, at that
time, to come from the South, it was particularly
necessary for the Archbishops to win to their side
Duke Louis of Bavaria, who was the principal rival
and enemy of Ottakar. Bavaria had recently been
divided into two parts, between the two brothers
Louis and Henry; and the warm friendship of Henry
for Ottakar had strengthened the opposition of Louis.
Louis, indeed, may have himself dreamt of the
Imperial crown; but neither the Archbishops, nor the
more northern Electors, were disposed to concede this
dignity to him. They had, however, a bait which was
sufficiently attractive to the Duke.</p>

<p>It appeared that in the year 1257, the Duke of
Bavaria had taken part in one of those confused elections
to the Empire which had given an opportunity
for every kind of irregular interference. The Archbishops
now proposed to recognise this precedent as
conferring on the Duke of Bavaria the position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Elector of the Empire, and thus completing the
mystic number of seven, without the help of the
King of Bohemia. A candidate for the throne had,
however, still to be found; and, as the idea of choosing
one of the more powerful princes was now definitely
abandoned, the Margrave of Brandenburg and the
Duke of Saxony put forward a kinsman of their own,
named Siegfried of Anhalt.</p>

<p>The majority, however, of the Electors, and the
most active spirits among them, desired to strengthen
their position in the South rather than the North
of Germany; and it was now that Frederick of
Hohenzollern, the Burggraf of Nürnberg, brought
forward the candidate for whom he had been secretly
preparing the way. This was Count Rudolf of
Hapsburg, the owner of a castle near the Lake of
Constance, who had become known in his own neighbourhood
as the protector and champion of Bern and
other growing towns. He had gained considerable
reputation for military ability; and he had evidently
some of that personal power of fascination so
important to a great ruler. Fortunately for his chances
of success he had already attracted the attention of
Werner of Mainz, at the time when the Archbishop
was on his journey to Rome to be confirmed in his
diocese. But, besides this important support, Rudolf
had another source of influence, the peculiar use of
which was to be a marked characteristic of his descendants.
He had a large number of marriageable
daughters. One of these was promised to the Count
Palatine of the Rhine; and by marriage with another
the Duke of Saxony was persuaded to abandon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
cause of Siegfried of Anhalt. By what means the
Elector of Brandenburg was won over is not quite
clear; and, in all probability, he was the least willing
of the Imperial Electors to grant his support to
Rudolf. His opposition, however, cannot at this
time have been very decided; for, when the Electors
held their formal meeting, the resolution to support
Rudolf was unanimous.</p>

<p>Thus far the intrigues appear by some mysterious
means to have been kept from the knowledge of
Ottakar. But such an arrangement could not long be
hid. Henry of Bavaria must necessarily have been
admitted to the knowledge of some of these proceedings;
and, although the Electors were anxious to
conciliate him, he was not yet prepared to abandon
his friendship for Ottakar. Probably, therefore, it
was through his means that Ottakar had received
notice of the meeting of the final Assembly for deciding
the election; and he was able, therefore, to
send a representative to it. Apparently, however, the
King of Bohemia had not even yet realised the
full extent of his enemies’ intrigues; and it was with
the greatest surprise and indignation that his representative
discovered that the meeting to which he had
been summoned was merely called to confirm an election
already previously agreed upon. That Ottakar
should be indignant at this ignoring of his electoral
rights was natural enough; but the amazement and
horror which the election of Rudolf excited in his
mind can only be described in his own words.</p>

<p>In November, 1273, he addressed to Pope
Gregory X., who had then been recently elected, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
protest against the decision of the Electoral College.
Beginning with a most glowing and somewhat fulsome
description of the Papacy, he then proceeds as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wherefore, if the commonwealth is ever oppressed,
neither reason nor our wishes allow us to have recourse
to any but you. Whence, since the Princes of
Germany who have the power of choosing the Cæsars
have agreed (we would not speak with spiteful poison,
nor has detraction a place in a royal speech) to direct
their votes to a less suitable Count, in spite of the
protest of our customary messengers whom we sent
to Wrauenwrt, where the election ought to have been
held; and since, to the injury of the Empire and to
our prejudice, after our appeal to the Apostolic Chair,
they have decorated him with the majesty of the
sacred diadem, we return to you as the inexhaustible
fountain of justice and piety, entreating your Holiness
not to permit us to be trampled on in our rights,
which the aforesaid princes try to crush down with
manifest injuries; and that you will deign to turn
your sacred mind to the weeping state of the Empire;
and that the blessed benignity of Mother Church will
take compassion on it; since that Empire, before which
the whole world has trembled, which was entrusted
with all the most excellent dignities of monarchy,
has now fallen to those persons whom obscurity hides
from fame, who are deprived of power and strength,
and weighed down by the burden of poverty. Pity
us! holiest Father! lest <i>that</i> which is so pressed down
may be seen to be most unworthy; since, if the Apostolic
Chair permits it, if the world tolerates it, that so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
high an exaltation should be granted to those that
are low, it would be reduced to nothing; and <i>that</i>
which the Arab has served, the Indian has obeyed,
the Italian has submitted to, the Spaniard has looked
up to, which the whole world has reverenced, should
become despicable in the eyes of all. Him whom the
Senate and Roman people, whom law and virtue,
whom God Himself has established on the throne,
every one will despise as scorning the bridle of a poor
man. And thus justice will be stifled, concord will
be banished, peace will perish in a reign of crimes,
injuries will flourish unpunished, neighbour will rise
against neighbour, and such calamity and misery will
hang over us that all who live will hate their life.”</p>

<p>Surely a more pathetic appeal was rarely addressed
by a great ruler to the head of the Christian
Church. But Gregory X., though willing like his
predecessors to be on good terms with the King of
Bohemia, was probably not so ill-informed of the
affairs of Europe as not to know that many of the
evils which Ottakar depicted as likely to follow on
Rudolf’s election, had already disturbed the Empire
for many years past; and he was soon to be convinced
that the election of Rudolf might be the best
way of removing them. Rudolf, on his part, lost no
time and spared no pains in destroying in the Pope’s
mind the only objection which might possibly have
interfered with his acceptance. While eager to
secure his recognition and coronation as Holy Roman
Emperor by the Pope, Rudolf, more than any Emperor
since Henry the Fowler, desired to be, in all essentials,
merely a German King. He eagerly assured the Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
that he had not the slightest wish to assert those
claims in Italy and Sicily which had brought Frederick
II. and other emperors into collision with the Papacy;
nay, he would even defend the nominees of the Pope
in their claims on Sicily, and would in all things be
the faithful servant of the Church. But, though
Gregory very soon showed an inclination to accept
the choice of the German Electors, he still paused on
the brink of so important a decision; and this pause
was ingeniously used by the ablest of Ottakar’s advisers,
Bruno, Bishop of Olmütz. Gregory, who seems
to have been one of the most high-minded Popes
of the period, was sincerely desirous of restoring
a better state of things in Europe, partly as a
preparation for a new expedition to Palestine. In
order to ascertain the real feeling and purposes of the
Christians of Europe, he requested various bishops to
report to him on the condition of the countries with
which they were acquainted. Whatever other results
this appeal may have produced, Bruno saw in it an
admirable opportunity for furthering his master’s
interests. The growth of heresy, the maintenance
of the Cumani by the King of Hungary, the extreme
poverty and misery of the clergy, the indifference
of the bulk of the people to religious services, the
intrusion of the mendicant friars into the offices of
the parochial clergy and bishops, the unwillingness of
the laity to hear their sins denounced, and the continual
encroachment of lay judges on the privileges of
the clergy&mdash;all these evils are aggravated by the elevation
to high places of those who ought rather to be
subjects. The only trustworthy champion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Christian faith is the King of Bohemia; even in the
very diocese of Prague he is the only patron who
grants the presentation of the clergy to the bishops;
and on him mainly will fall the burden of resisting a
new Tartar invasion. Bruno undoubtedly stood high
in the opinion of Gregory; and, even apart from his
advice, there were obvious grounds for inquiry in the
circumstances of Rudolf’s election. A Council was
therefore held at Lyons for the full investigation of
this question; an unusually large number of bishops
attended it; and it doubtless received dignity in the
eyes of many by the presence of Thomas Aquinas
and Bonaventura. Bruno’s protest was heard at full;
while, on the other hand, Rudolf’s readiness to meet
the demands of the Pope, and to acknowledge the
rights of the clergy was pressed upon Gregory’s
attention. Anxious to treat Ottakar mildly, but conscious
that the Church and the Empire would both
gain by the election of Rudolf, Gregory decided that,
though Ottakar’s claim to share in the election was
undoubtedly just, yet, as the six other Electors took
the opposite side to that which he advocated, he was
in the minority, and ought therefore to yield; and
the Pope persuaded Bruno to use his influence with
his master in favour of Rudolf.</p>

<p>But the question, in the meantime, was assuming a
new aspect. Rudolf’s alarm at the opposition of
Ottakar, and his desire to secure all the Imperial
rights, were combining with other circumstances to
induce him to put forward a claim for the restoration
to the Empire of the Duchies of Austria, Styria,
Carniola, and Carinthia. Ottakar had been unwilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
to resist the pressure of the Pope and the advice
of Bruno; but he now demanded that, before doing
homage to Rudolf, he should have a clear guarantee
for the possession of the lands that he had conquered.</p>

<p>In his determination to resist the demands of
Rudolf, Ottakar seems to have been strangely unaware
of the dangers that were surrounding him.
Rudolf was, in the meantime, making allies with
great sagacity. Count Meinhard of the Tyrol had
been the Count of Hapsburg’s most intimate friend;
and he was one of the many who looked with jealous
eyes on Ottakar’s possession of Carinthia. The
Archbishop of Salzburg had claimed some rights
in Styria, and was besides continually harassed
by encroachments on the part of Ottakar; Henry
of Bavaria had been one of those to whom the
nobles of Styria had offered their dukedom; and
though his friendship for Ottakar shows that he
must have abandoned this claim for a time, the
offer of one of Rudolf’s useful daughters finally detached
him from his alliance with Bohemia.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the indefatigable Burggraf of
Nürnberg had discovered and fomented the discontents
of the nobles of Austria and Styria; and he
announced to Ottakar that the Ban of the Empire
had been proclaimed against him. But even now
Ottakar was unaware of Rudolf’s plans; he probably
despised his military ability; and he thought it
sufficient to send a small force to the defence of the
Bohemian frontier, while he gave himself up to
hunting and other amusements. He was, therefore,
terribly startled when, in September, 1276, Rudolf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
suddenly entered Austria. Almost at the same
time Count Meinhard invaded Carinthia, and the
Styrian nobles, rising in insurrection, drove out
Milota from their country. Still Ottakar hoped to
save himself by the devotion of the towns; for six
months, Vienna justified his expectations by holding
out against Rudolf’s army; and Paltram, the Burgomaster,
roused the citizens to a vigorous defence on
behalf of the King, who had showed them such
favour. Ottakar, now stirred to action, marched into
Austria and occupied one side of the Danube; from
whence he hoped to make an attack on the rear of
Rudolf’s army. But the Count Palatine of the Rhine
hastened to seize the fortresses which lay between
him and the German army; and it was now that
Ottakar became thoroughly aware of the defection
of his nobles. Fortress after fortress surrendered to
Rudolf without a struggle; and at last the poorer
men in Vienna, seeing the continual destruction of
their vineyards outside the city, called upon Paltram
to surrender. He, finding that Ottakar did not arrive,
despaired of holding out longer; though, before
surrendering, he exacted from Rudolf a promise that
he would maintain the liberties of Vienna.</p>

<p>As soon as Bruno of Olmütz heard of this loss,
he advised Ottakar to yield. Ottakar was most
reluctant that the struggle should end without a
pitched battle; but another enemy now threatened to
appear on the scene. Ladislaus, the new king of
Hungary, was smarting under the recollection of the
defeats which his predecessor had sustained; and
he prepared to invade Bohemia. This new danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
seems to have decided Ottakar to yield. He therefore
publicly surrendered to Rudolf all his claims on
Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola, and did
homage to him as Emperor for his kingdom of
Bohemia and Moravia. Such a settlement could not
possibly be lasting. Ottakar had not yet been
defeated in any pitched battle; his wife Kunigunda
is said to have reproached him for his weakness in
yielding so soon; and, in the carrying out of the
treaty which followed, numerous questions, of doubtful
interpretation, quickly came to the front. In this
case, one of Rudolf’s otherwise successful daughters
proved a source of contention rather than of unity.
Guta, the daughter whom Rudolf had offered as a
bride to Ottakar’s son, had been promised large lands
as her dowry; and Ottakar maintained that, as these
lands must necessarily lie in Austria, he was not
bound to evacuate those territories, but should rather
claim them as his due. Rudolf, on the other hand,
insisted that the terms of the treaty involved the
evacuation of the whole of Austria.</p>

<p>A question which must have touched Ottakar far
more nearly was the interpretation of the clause about
the extension to the supporters of each King of all
the securities gained by the peace. The discontent
of the nobles with Ottakar’s rule had extended
even to Bohemia and Moravia; and many of the
king’s native subjects had entered into intrigues
with Rudolf. Rudolf maintained that, as these
men must be considered his supporters, they were
entitled to the same concessions as the other
champions of his cause. It was obvious that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
grounds of division as these, by whatever compromise
they might be settled at the moment, must leave a
lasting sting behind them; and there is no sign in
the letters of either King of even such a pretence of
friendship, as the ordinary exigencies of diplomacy
might seem to require. Both Rudolf and Ottakar
were, in fact, preparing for a new struggle, and looking
about for allies.</p>

<p>At this stage the chances seemed to be in
favour of Ottakar. In the first struggle he could
rely on nothing but the military forces of his own
kingdom, and the sympathies of those citizens whom
he had favoured; while Rudolf was backed by the
approval and encouragement of the great princes of
the Empire, by the sanction of the Pope, by the
assistance of the King of Hungary, and by the eager
sympathy and co-operation of the discontented subjects
of Ottakar.</p>

<p>Now, these supporters seemed to be gradually
dropping off from the Emperor. Rudolf had by no
means abandoned that championship of the towns for
which he had been so distinguished before his election
to the Imperial throne; and of all the enemies
of the town life of Germany the prince-bishops were
looked upon as the most determined and dangerous.
Rudolf had therefore to choose between adherence to
his old policy and the favour of his archiepiscopal
supporters. With a courage which was doubtless
united to far-sighted wisdom, he boldly defended the
municipal rights of Köln against the encroachments
of its Archbishop. That powerful Elector was thus
completely alienated from Rudolf’s cause; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
speedily succeeded in persuading his brother Archbishops
of Trier and Mainz to desert their nominee.
The defection of Werner of Mainz so alarmed
Rudolf that he seemed disposed to make some
sacrifice of principle in order to conciliate him.
But the concessions which the Emperor offered
were not sufficient to appease the jealousies and
suspicions of the Archbishop; and Werner now
began to listen only too readily to the advances of
Ottakar.</p>

<p>The Margrave of Brandenburg can never have
been a warm supporter of Rudolf. He had married
Ottakar’s sister; and he was united to him also by
the still closer link of military comradeship; for
Ottakar and he had fought side by side in one of
those invasions of Prussia, which were supposed to
be so advantageous to the souls of the heathen
population, and which undoubtedly tended to increase
the power and territory of the Margrave of
Brandenburg. Nor does the Duke of Saxony seem
to have been finally secured to the interest of Rudolf
by the marriage with his daughter. Even the Dukes
of Bavaria did not feel that they had profited as
much as they had hoped to do by their support of
the Emperor; and they were not a little alarmed at
his evident intention to turn the provinces, which
he had won for the Empire, into a private possession
of the House of Hapsburg. Nor was Rudolf more
fortunate when he tried to find allies abroad whose
support might compensate him for the loss of his
friends at home. In vain he made advances to our
Edward I.; and an attempt to strengthen his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
by alliances with the princes of Italy, had the sole
result of exciting the suspicions and enmity of Pope
Nicholas III.</p>

<p>Ottakar was, of course, greatly encouraged by these
secessions from his rival; and he hoped still further
to strengthen his own position by detaching the King
of Hungary from his alliance with Rudolf, and by
stirring up an insurrection in Austria. In both these
efforts, however, he was unsuccessful. The conspiracy
formed by some of the Austrian nobles, in concert
with the still discontented Burgomaster of Vienna,
was detected by Rudolf before it had come to a
head; and while Paltram was forced to save himself
by flight, one of the leading nobles was seized
and condemned to death.</p>

<p>The discovery of this conspiracy seems to have
been the signal for the new outbreak of war; and
it was now apparent that Rudolf had not been
wholly weakened by the desertion of his powerful
supporters. The forces on which he could still rely
were more ready to act under his command than
the great princes of the Empire would have been;
and his one independent ally probably gave him
more efficient help than he could have derived from
any distant general. This was Ladislaus of Hungary,
who had been firmly secured to Rudolf’s side, partly
by the gift of one of his inexhaustible tribe of
daughters, and partly by a vague promise of extension
of territory. Ottakar was apparently unaware
of the firmness of this alliance; and he entered
Austria with a somewhat small force, expecting an
easy victory. One or two fortresses fell quickly into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
his hands; but the sudden appearance of the King of
Hungary at the head of a large army took him completely
by surprise; and, after suffering a slight
defeat, he found it convenient to retreat to some
distance.</p>

<p>Rudolf in the meantime had rallied round him
his most determined supporters. Chief among these
was Frederick of Hohenzollern; and the Emperor
also received ready help from Count Meinhard of
the Tyrol, the Archbishop of Salzburg, and the
Bishop of Basel. Besides these supporters, he had
under his command a strong force of South
Germans; while fiercest and keenest of all the
soldiers in his ranks were those who fought under
the banners of the discontented Styrian nobles.</p>

<p>The rival armies met on the banks of the river
Morava on the plain called the Marchfeld. The
battle was a fierce one. The Bishop of Basel and
Frederick of Hohenzollern broke the left wing of the
Bohemian army; while, on the other side, Ottakar,
at the head of a chosen band of knights, drove back
the right wing of the Imperialists, and even struck
down the Emperor himself. But the Styrian nobles
so fiercely resisted the advance of the Bohemians,
that they gave time to Rudolf to reform his troops;
while Frederick of Hohenzollern followed up his success
by attacking the reserve guard, which ought to
have advanced to Ottakar’s rescue. These reserves
were headed by Milota, Ottakar’s Governor of
Styria. It is said that Milota himself had a bitter
grievance against the king, on account of an injury
inflicted on his brother. Whether this is true or not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
it seems certain that, just when these troops ought to
have hastened to the support of the main army, they
were suddenly seized with a panic, and fled in confusion.
The panic quickly spread to the troops
posted next to them; and the battle was hopelessly
lost. Ottakar fought with desperate courage to the
last; and, whether he died sword in hand, or whether,
as others say, he was killed by the Styrian nobles
after he had surrendered, it is certain that his body
was found on the battlefield.</p>

<p>With him, for a time, fell the liberty and independence
of Bohemia; and, though his son bore the
name of king, and even recovered for a short period
an appearance of independence, yet, politically considered,
the male line of those Bohemian native
rulers, who traced their descent to Libus̆a and
Pr̆emysl, came to an end on the plain of Marchfeld
in August, 1278. Bohemian independence was, indeed,
to revive under a different form; and, nearly
two centuries later, a native Bohemian king was once
more to rule at Prague; but never again was a purely
Bohemian dynasty to be established on the throne.</p>

<p>With all its faults, the line of the Pr̆emyslovci had
produced as many able and patriotic rulers as most
royal houses can boast of. They had steered their
country through its difficult progress from Paganism
to Christianity. They had reduced the rival kingdom
of Poland from the position of a dangerous aggressor
into that of a tributary State. They had helped to
roll back the tide of Hungarian conquest; they had
made themselves a powerful factor in the policy of
the German Empire. Amid the despair of Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
they had stood almost alone against the crushing
invasion of the Tartars. And last, and most important
of all, they had begun to develop the
municipal liberties of their country, in a way which
gave good promise of future prosperity. That in
this last matter they had borrowed largely from
German models, only showed their power of rising
superior to a most natural national prejudice; while,
in the case of Ottakar II., his enlightened policy towards
the Jews must have often brought upon him the
rebukes of those clergy on whom he so much relied
for help. He failed, because he was not content to
be king of Bohemia, but wished to be the head of a
powerful State which could dictate the policy of the
Empire. Had he been satisfied to develop the
liberties of his own country in peace, he might have
laid the foundations of a State, which could even now
have been playing an independent part in the affairs
of Europe.</p>

<h2>V.<br />
<span class="smaller">TIME OF ANARCHY IN BOHEMIA FROM DEATH OF
OTTAKAR II. TO ACCESSION OF CHARLES IV.<br />
(1278-1346.)</span></h2>

<p>If tried by the standard of ordinary conquerors,
Rudolf of Hapsburg must be admitted to have been
merciful, and even generous, in his dealings with
Bohemia. Although, after the death of Ottakar, he
continued for some time to hold Moravia as a conquered
province, he set himself to restore those
Moravian cities which had suffered by the war; and
he readily confirmed all the municipal liberties, which
had been granted by Ottakar and previous kings.
He always treated Kunigunda as a Queen; he secured
to her, not only her own money dowry, but also that
district of Opava (in Moravia) which had been
specially settled upon her; and, as will be seen, he
protected her from the cruelty of the friends in
whom she had too rashly trusted. To her son,
Wenceslaus, he was even more generous. The
daughter whom he had promised in 1276 to the son
of the still powerful King of Bohemia, he was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
ready to give to the orphan of a defeated and conquered
man.</p>

<p>As soon as the boy’s age permitted such a step, he
restored him to his father’s throne, and helped him,
sometimes by wise advice and sometimes by force
of arms, to maintain his power over his subjects.
Doubtless this policy, however magnanimous, was
part of a scheme of action which tended to strengthen
and increase Rudolf’s power. The towns in Moravia,
whose liberties he confirmed, he raised into free
cities of the German Empire; and he saw the
wisdom of winning to his side, and holding in friendly
subjection, the young and spirited King of a kingdom
which had so often been a hindrance to schemes of
Imperial policy. Yet, allowing for these considerations,
it cannot be denied that the consistent
execution of such a policy must have required a
masterly self-restraint, and a splendid coolness of
judgment, not often found in conquerors of any time.</p>

<p>But the feat which he had attempted was one which
many circumstances combined to make impossible;
and men, of a very opposite type to Rudolf’s,
speedily frustrated his efforts for a peaceable and
gradual absorption of Bohemia in the German Empire.
Queen Kunigunda had naturally desired to make a
further stand against her husband’s conqueror; and
she called to her aid the son of that Otto of Brandenburg
who had been Ottakar’s companion in arms,
and afterwards his brother-in-law. He came; and
the queen had speedy cause to regret her invitation.
The struggle between Otto and Rudolf was of short
duration, and the Margrave was soon willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
accept the Emperor’s terms of peace and one of his
inexhaustible tribe of daughters.</p>

<p>Otto soon showed that it was not for the sake of
the wife and son of his old friend that he had come
to Bohemia. Under pretence of investigating some
old charter of Ottakar’s, Otto sent German soldiers to
Prague to find out the places where Ottakar’s bailiff
had kept the royal treasure. These soldiers entered
one of the chief monasteries, and there discovered a
large chest which had been used by many people
during the war as a storehouse for food, clothes, and
other property. This chest the Germans at once
broke open and plundered of its contents; and then,
as if determined to offend the national feeling to the
utmost, they rushed into the chapel of St. Wenceslaus
and rifled the tomb of the saint.</p>

<p>These outrages were followed by a yet more daring
act of violence. Otto suddenly entered Prague by
night, seized the queen and prince in their rooms,
while still half dressed, and carried them off to a
fortress, where he set German soldiers to guard them,
and would permit no Bohemian to see them. Some
Bohemian nobles demanded the release of these
captives, and Otto promised to set them free; but he
broke his promise. Kunigunda, indeed, by a series
of ruses, succeeded in escaping from her imprisonment
and taking refuge in her own special dominions
at Opava; but her boy remained a prisoner in Otto’s
hands.</p>

<p>In the meantime the soldiers, who had been brought
in by Otto to carry out his tyrannical purposes, began
a series of plundering expeditions on their own account.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
The unfortunate peasants fled from their
fields and took refuge in the woods, leaving the
lands wholly uncultivated. Even worse calamities
fell on the towns. The large-minded policy of the
two Ottakars and of Wenceslaus I. now proved a
source of evil and division. They had tried to
induce Germans and Bohemians to live together in
towns, established under German municipal laws,
and often peopled in the first instance by German
immigrants. But these enlightened kings had not
been able thereby to stifle race-hatred and jealousy;
and the German settlers now looked upon the wild
soldiers of Otto as their allies against the native
Bohemian citizens. They invited the leaders of the
plundering parties into the towns, and with their help
expelled the Bohemians. Prague was the only city
strong enough to resist this Germanising process;
and Tobias, the Bishop of Prague, tried to rally the
faithful nobles of the kingdom round Kunigunda.
This effort was a desperate one; and, even when Otto
left Bohemia for a time, his viceroy, the Bishop of
Brandenburg, carried his ruthless policy still further,
plundering the clergy and treating the remonstrances
of Bishop Tobias with scorn and insolence.</p>

<p>At last the Bohemians were forced to call in their
former conqueror to deliver them from this cruel
tyranny; and Otto soon succumbed to the Imperial
forces. He consented to summon an Assembly at
Prague, at which he appointed Bishop Tobias as chief
ruler of the kingdom; and he further issued a decree
that those Germans who had entered Bohemia for
the purposes of plunder should leave the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
within three days. He again promised to release
young Wenceslaus, and again broke his promise.
The German robbers, awed doubtless by the power
of Rudolf, hastened to obey the orders of their
master. But the evil seed which they had sown did
not cease to produce its natural fruits.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that for three years the
lands had been left uncultivated; and trade, except
where carried on by Germans, had been totally
paralysed. The consequence of these misfortunes
was a terrible famine. Unemployed workmen and
starving peasants crowded into Prague and enforced
by violence their demands for food and clothing.
Driven out by the authorities of the city, they perished
of cold in the woods; large holes were filled with
the dead bodies; family affection ceased in the
bitter struggle for life; and, when all kinds of strange
food had been tried and exhausted, mothers killed
and ate their own children.</p>

<p>At last, in 1283, a better harvest began to restore
some hope for a return to human conditions of life.
Then wild rumours and speculations fed the rising
expectation. A beautiful rainbow was the source of
bright prophecies; and a half belief began to arise
in some minds that King Ottakar was not really
dead, and would return in triumph. Suddenly a
definite announcement took the place of dreams and
fancies. Not Ottakar, but his son Wenceslaus, was
to return to reign in Bohemia. Base and sordid to
the last, Otto had demanded from the half-starved
Bohemians a ransom of 35,000 marks, as compensation
for what he called his care and expense in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
guarding the young Bohemian king, in reality as a
bribe not to break any more promises. But the sum
was paid, and no doubt willingly.</p>

<p>There is something inexpressibly touching in the
enthusiasm which greeted the return of the twelve-year-old
king. Men, hardly recovered from years of
starvation and plague, seemed at once convinced that
at last a better time was coming; and on June 9,
1283, barons, knights, clergy, citizens, and peasants
flocked out to meet the young king, Bishop Tobias
leading the motley throng, and all singing the hymn
of St. Adalbert, the opening words of which had
served Ottakar as a war-cry at the fatal battle of the
Marchfeld.</p>

<p>But the troubles of Bohemia were not yet at an
end. The boy followed his most natural instinct
in appealing to his mother to join him in Prague.
Unfortunately, Kunigunda had in the meantime
formed a connection which proved most dangerous
to the peace and order of the country. Zavis̆ of
Falkenstein belonged to a noble family of Moravia,
and he had succeeded in securing the queen’s affection
during her residence in Opava. Whether the
marriage, which was recognised at a later time, had
already taken place, or whether, as some said, their
connection was one of illicit love, certain it is that it
was the affection between them, rather than the form
of its expression, which excited the indignation and
jealousy of the Bohemian nobles; and Zavis̆ soon
justified that indignation.</p>

<p>No sooner did he appear at the Court of Prague
than he set himself to oppose and drive away such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
patriots as Bishop Tobias, and to put his own favourites
in their place. An insurrection quickly followed;
and though Rudolf exerted himself to pacify the
insurgents, he soon showed in an unmistakable
manner his own distrust of the new ruler of Bohemia.</p>

<p>In January, 1285, Wenceslaus, now arrived at his
fourteenth year, was married to Guta, the daughter of
Rudolf. Zavis̆ was so conscious of Rudolf’s distrust,
that he did not venture to enter the town where the
marriage was solemnised. This absence, however,
did not satisfy the Emperor; and he took the extreme
step of carrying back Guta with him, after her
marriage, to preserve her from the influences which
prevailed at Prague. Either encouraged by these
signs of Rudolf’s feelings, or irritated by some new
insolence on the part of Zavis̆, the Bohemian nobles
raised a second insurrection; but they were again
unsuccessful, and it was not till the death of Kunigunda,
in 1287, that Wenceslaus succeeded in shaking
off the power of his stepfather.</p>

<p>An excellent excuse for this final effort for freedom
was supplied by Rudolf, who declared that he would
not restore Guta to her husband until Zavis̆ was
banished from the court. Wenceslaus was, no doubt,
glad enough to get back his wife in exchange for his
stepfather; and, when Zavis̆ intrigued with the King
of Hungary and tried to entrap Wenceslaus, the
young king decoyed him back to Prague and there
imprisoned him. The friends of Zavis̆, both in
Hungary and Bohemia, attempted his rescue; but
Rudolf again intervened; and after the Hungarian
invasion had been repelled, Wenceslaus was at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
persuaded by his Imperial father-in-law to put Zavis̆
to death.</p>

<p>The young king now devoted himself to the restoration
of order. He broke down castles, encouraged
trade, extended the liberties of the cities, and gained
a high reputation for justice. He even attempted to
substitute for the vague mass of traditional custom a
regular code of written laws; but in this attempt he
was defeated by the nobles, who often showed themselves
too strong for him.</p>

<p>The fatality which seemed to attend the best and
most law-loving kings of Bohemia dragged Wenceslaus
also into the complications of Imperial and
Polish politics. In 1291 Rudolf died; and it soon
became evident how bitter was the hostility which
the Hapsburg family had excited among the princes
of Germany.</p>

<p>Albert, the son of Rudolf, had indeed made good
his power in the dukedoms of Austria and Styria, but
he had shown little sign of his father’s vigour or
ability; and the suspicion felt by the Bohemians
towards the whole house of Hapsburg was increased,
in the case of Albert, by the personal quarrels which
had embittered his relations with his brother-in-law,
Wenceslaus. Rudolf, indeed, had made great efforts
to preserve the peace; but, as soon as he was dead,
the quarrel again broke out, and Wenceslaus joined
with other Electors of the Empire to choose Adolf of
Nassau as Emperor, in opposition to Albert.</p>

<p>His success in securing this election left the King
of Bohemia free to carry on the struggle with Poland.
He recovered the often-disputed town of Cracow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
resumed that claim to the kingdom of Poland which,
in some form or other, had been traditional in
Bohemia since the time of King Vladislav. Adolf
would gladly have strengthened the allegiance of
Wenceslaus by this or any other concession; but
Albert had an advantage which eventually enabled
him to outbid his rival. He still retained in his
hands the towns of Eger (Cheb) and Pilsen (Plz̆en),
which his father had never surrendered to Bohemia.
These towns, from their nearness to the Bavarian
frontier, might be specially dangerous to the Bohemians
if held by an enemy of their country; and
their restoration to Wenceslaus meant the practical
revival of Bohemian independence. This bribe therefore
proved too strong for Wenceslaus’s faith; he
withdrew his support from Adolf, and helped to
place Albert on the throne of the Empire. In the
following year the King of Poland finally surrendered
his crown to Wenceslaus; and in 1300 Albert
gave his Imperial sanction to the union of Poland
with Bohemia.</p>

<p>There was yet another kingdom whose internal
affairs had always a dangerous attraction for the
kings of Bohemia. In 1301 the direct line of the
old kings of Hungary came to an end; and a
Hungarian bishop, backed by some of the nobles,
offered the crown to Wenceslaus. The young king,
though refusing the offer on his own account, was
disposed to accept it on behalf of his son; but this
acceptance brought upon him the hostility of the two
greatest Powers of Europe. The Pope complained
that the election was uncanonical; because the bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
who had taken the leading part in it was not authorised
to crown the kings of Hungary. The Emperor
Albert, on his side, had already become suspicious of
the growing power of Bohemia; and, according to
one chronicler, his avarice had been excited by the
fame of the silver mines at Kuttenberg (Kutna Hora).
Wenceslaus, indeed, though ready enough to hold his
own against the Emperor, was as anxious as his father
had been to remain on good terms with the Pope.
He acknowledged the irregularity in the form of his
son’s election; and, at the same time, he entreated
the Pope to secure him the crown in a canonical
manner. But it soon appeared that Boniface’s complaint
about the form of election was a mere pretext,
and that the Pope was really intending to grant
the crown of Hungary to the King of Naples. To
this arrangement Wenceslaus would not consent;
and hence it came that in 1304 he was compelled to
defend Bohemia against the forces of the Empire,
supported by the authority of the Pope. This time,
however, there was no division in the national feeling.
However unwelcome some of Wenceslaus’s schemes
might be to the Bohemian nobles, they had too
recently learnt, by bitter experience, the folly of
deserting a national king for a foreign invader. The
Bohemians offered a unanimous resistance to the
Imperial army, and Albert was forced to retreat.</p>

<p>But the doom of the male line of the House of
Pr̆emysl was, none the less, hopelessly fixed. Wenceslaus
died in the following year; and his son, after
resigning his claim to the kingdom of Hungary, gave
himself up to dissipation and profligacy. The Poles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
began to revolt; and during an expedition to Cracow
the last of the male line of the Pr̆emyslovci was
murdered by a traitor.</p>

<p class="caption">CATHEDRAL OF OLMÜTZ On SITE OF CASTLE WHERE

</div>

<p>It seemed for the moment as if the turn of the
House of Hapsburg had once more come. During
the bitter divisions in the Bohemian Assembly which
followed the death of their king, Albert succeeded
in thrusting his son Rudolf on the attention of the
Electors; and the majority of those who were present
consented to elect this prince to the Bohemian throne,
and even to declare their crown hereditary in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
House of Hapsburg. But this success was only
momentary, for a fierce hatred of the Hapsburgs was
deeply rooted in the Bohemians; and, by a curious
irony of fortune, the opponents of Rudolf called to
their aid the son of that Duke of Carinthia who had
won his Dukedom by supporting Rudolf’s grandfather
against Ottakar II. Rudolf died after a few months;
and the majority of the next Assembly chose Henry
of Carinthia as their king.</p>

<p>But Albert would not yet yield; and he set up his
son Frederick as Rudolf’s successor. The fight was
a fierce one; and it was soon changed from the
attempt of an Emperor to conquer a new kingdom
into a struggle of the House of Hapsburg to maintain
its political existence. The opposition to that House
was due, not only to the bitter Bohemian feeling
against the German oppressor, nor yet to the jealousy
felt by the great Princes of the Empire towards successful
upstarts, but also to the hatred of those townsmen
and peasants who had looked to Rudolf as their
protector, and who found in his descendants their most
deadly enemies.</p>

<p>In May, 1308, the Emperor Albert was murdered
by his nephew; and, as the murderer was the son
of Ottakar’s daughter, he was looked upon by the
Bohemians as the avenger of his grandfather. The
Electors of the Empire were now resolved that no
further chance should be given to the House of
Hapsburg; and Henry of Luxemburg was elected
to the Imperial throne. The fate of Bohemia once
more followed that of the Empire; for the new
Emperor quickly saw his opportunity in the unpopularity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of both the claimants of the Bohemian crown.
He secured the hand of Elizabeth, the daughter of
Wenceslaus, for his son John, and thus paved the way
for the latter’s succession to the Bohemian throne.
Hence it came about that in 1310 the Estates of
Prague enthusiastically welcomed John of Luxemburg
as their king.</p>

<p>It even seemed, for the moment, as if this election
would be the signal for a yet more complete victory
of the House of Luxemburg over that of Hapsburg;
for, at the very same time, the Austrians suddenly
rose against their Dukes, and expelled them from all
but three towns of the Duchy. But the Emperor
Henry refused to encourage this insurrection; and
the Hapsburgs continued to maintain their position
as Dukes of Austria.</p>

<p>Few kings have ever succeeded to the rule of a
foreign country with a better hope of popularity than
did John of Luxemburg. The terrible years of anarchy
had made the Bohemians desirous of a strong government,
and ready to welcome any one who seemed to
have force and vigour enough to restore order. As
the rival of the hated House of Hapsburg, and the
deliverer from the incapable Henry of Carinthia, the
new king was specially acceptable; while his marriage
with the daughter of Wenceslaus might have almost
cheated the enthusiastic Bohemians into the belief
that they were once more to be governed by a
national sovereign. John, too, seemed willing enough
to meet these aspirations more than half way. He
not only recognised that claim, which had been
formerly asserted against Vladislav, that Bohemians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
should not be called to fight outside their kingdom;
but he declared that no official should be appointed
in Bohemia or Moravia who was not a native of those
countries; and, more startling still, that none but
natives should be suffered to buy lands, inheritances,
fortresses, or any other rights within the country.</p>

<p>But it soon became evident that, if these promises
were to be kept to the ear, they were certain to be
broken to the sense. The earliest cause of offence,
was, no doubt, one which might be excused to a boy of
fourteen. By the advice of his father, John accepted
the Archbishop of Mainz as his chief counsellor, and
gradually drew around him a number of German
courtiers. It appears, indeed, from trustworthy evidence,
that this German Churchman preserved better
order in Bohemia than that which prevailed in the
latter part of John’s reign; yet his position was,
notwithstanding, a most difficult one, and several
circumstances combined to make it impossible.</p>

<p>The national feeling of independence, which had
been roused to new life by the promises of John, was
unfortunately manipulated at this period by one of
those unscrupulous intriguers who sometimes drift to
the front in times of disorder. His name was Henry
of Lipa; and he had already played a part in the
reign of Henry of Carinthia, in exciting the nobles
of Bohemia against the rulers of the towns.</p>

<p>Ever since the time of Ottakar II. the claim of the
towns to a share in the government of Bohemia was
being more strongly asserted; and a controversy
which, under their native rulers, might have been
settled by peaceful means, had led, in a time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
foreign tyranny, to an outbreak of civil war. In the
first phase of the struggle, the towns had so far made
good their claim that they were admitted to share in
the discussions of the Assembly which offered the
crown to John; and such a victory must have tended
to prejudice men like Henry of Lipa against the new
king.</p>

<p>Nor was it difficult to give a national colouring
to the class selfishness of the nobles. It will be
remembered that Ottakar II. had introduced a large
German element into the towns which he had
founded. This measure of wise policy had been
changed into a means of cruel oppression by Otto
of Brandenburg; and, unfortunately for the cause
of the towns, Otto had been, apparently, the first
ruler who summoned their representatives to share
in the deliberations of the Estates of the Realm.</p>

<p>Moreover, Henry of Lipa added to his class prejudices
a more personal reason for opposing the existing
government. He was attached to the widow of the
late King Rudolf, who was known to her supporters
as the Queen of Grätz; and he was resolved to make
good both her claims and his own at the expense of
the peace and order of the country.</p>

<p>To the unscrupulous intriguers who were plotting
against their power, John and the Archbishop of Mainz
were unfortunately soon to supply some just causes of
complaint. The death of the Emperor Henry seemed
to open to John a chance for claiming the Imperial
throne; and, when he found that his youth was held
to disqualify him for that dignity, he threw all his
influence on to the side of Louis of Bavaria, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
was resolved that no Hapsburg, at any rate, should
again become Holy Roman Emperor. This contest
withdrew both him and the Archbishop from Bohemia;
and the German Councillors who were left to support
the queen were little able to stand against Henry of
Lipa. John soon found that his championship of the
Bavarian cause was likely to involve him in a dangerous
war; and, fearing to leave a disturbed Bohemia
behind him, he hastened to satisfy his opponents by
dismissing his German advisers and taking Henry of
Lipa into his counsels.</p>

<p>A new Hungarian war which broke out at this time
enabled Henry to increase his power, and he used it
for inflicting new oppressions on the Bohemian towns.
But a bolder act of presumption at last exhausted
the patience of the Court. Henry ventured, without
consulting king or queen, to grant Agnes, the queen’s
sister, in marriage to a Duke of Silesia. This insolence
at last roused John to action, and Lipa was arrested.
Before any further steps could be taken, John was
once more called to the German war; and he again
left the Archbishop of Mainz as his viceroy. Henry
of Lipa once more appealed to Bohemian feeling
against the German prelate; and, though many of
the better men among the Bohemian nobility were
now disposed to stand by their queen, they were
not strong enough to hold their own against these
intrigues. John was now earnestly entreated to
return to Bohemia; but, when he hastened back, at
the head of his Rhenish forces, his Bohemian advisers
urged him to leave the Germans behind, and
to throw himself on the support of his faithful nobles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
John rejected this advice; he re-entered Bohemia at
the head of his German troops, and proceeded to
attack the lands of those nobles who had resisted
him.</p>

<p>A general panic now seized the Bohemians; they
recalled to their minds the tyranny of Otto of Brandenburg;
and the rumour quickly spread that John was
about to use German soldiers to crush out Bohemian
independence. What had been the intrigue of a mere
selfish faction, now swelled into a national opposition;
and the war raged fiercely. Henry of Lipa, indeed,
remained the ostensible leader of the insurgents; but
he had so little sympathy with real national feeling,
that he called in Frederick of Austria as his ally;
and, when John offered terms to the rebels, Henry
refused them, on the ground that any treaty of peace
must also include the Austrians. At last the Emperor
Louis intervened in the struggle. John was
persuaded to send away his Rhenish troops, to renew
his promise to appoint only Bohemian advisers, and
once more to give high office in the State to Henry
of Lipa. To these terms the king consented; but
Queen Elizabeth, with keener insight, refused altogether
to trust this new Councillor; and Henry thereupon
devoted his whole energies to making mischief
between the king and queen.</p>

<p>The intriguers had now discovered what manner of
man they had to deal with. Vain, profligate, and
pleasure-seeking, John was easily persuaded by the
young nobles that his wife had gained too much
power over him; and, when they had once sown in his
mind this suspicion, they were able to develop an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
elaborate romance of imaginary plots, by which the
queen was supposed to be undermining the throne of
John, and securing the power to herself and her son.
John’s selfish vanity soon drove him into violent
action. He hastened to the fortress where the queen
was then staying, and used such violent language that
she fled in terror from the place. Then he removed
from her her favourite attendants, carried off her
children, and shut up his eldest son for two months
in a dark room.</p>

<p>The indignation which this conduct caused among
the citizens of Bohemia was much increased by the
various forms of extortion which John now proceeded
to inflict both on towns and monasteries&mdash;extortions
devised solely to obtain money for the pleasures of
the King and his courtiers. John, indeed, had been
as ready as any other King of Bohemia to promise
the citizens exemption from certain forms of taxation;
and consequently they now complained, not only of
oppression, but also of broken faith. Nor was it
merely in the matter of taxes that the privileges of
the citizens were violated. In earlier times the nobles
had claimed the right of demanding forcible quartering
in the houses of citizens for those who were
engaged on expeditions in the king’s service. This
claim naturally led to great abuses, against which
Ottakar and Wenceslaus had tried to protect their
subjects. In this matter also John had promised to
carry out the policy of his predecessors. But he now
encouraged even his own kinsmen to demand this
compulsory entertainment. One citizen was seized
and crucified because he would not give up his money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to these intruders; others were plundered and unjustly
imprisoned.</p>

<p>At last the citizens of Prague drew up a formal
complaint, which they authorised six of their number
to present to John. Some mischief-maker persuaded
the king that this protest was a first step to insurrection;
and his suspicions were further inflamed by the
news that the queen had recently come to Prague,
and had been received with great honour. Furious
at this supposed conspiracy, the king and Henry of
Lipa at once marched against Prague. The citizens,
astonished at the interpretation which had been put
upon their remonstrance, were at first disposed to
admit the king, in the hopes of an easy explanation;
but some of the nobles, who had remained faithful to
the queen, were opposed to this policy; and they
offered such determined resistance, that John was
compelled to retreat from the city. A sort of truce
was patched up for a time, though John insisted that
the six citizens who had drawn up the remonstrance
should be expelled from the city. Then he hurried
away to finish the war between Louis and Frederick;
and Henry of Lipa was left chief ruler of the kingdom.
He soon succeeded in bringing to an end the
temporary reconciliation between John and Elizabeth;
and the queen was forced to fly to Bavaria, where
she remained for some time, in dependence on her
Bavarian relations, since John would not allow any
support to be sent to her from Bohemia.</p>

<p>Then followed many years of oppression and disorder,
during which John only appeared in Bohemia
when he wished to demand money from the citizens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
which he then hastened to spend at Paris or on the
Rhine, either in the provision of splendid tournaments,
or on some of the many wars which the princes of the
Empire were waging against each other or against the
Imperial towns. John’s special attraction was to
Paris, where the court of King Charles was becoming
a centre of pleasure and excitement. It was probably
his alliance with this king which gradually separated
John from the cause of Louis of Bavaria; for Charles
felt himself bound to stand by his dependant at
Avignon, Pope John XXII., who had always been
opposed to the claims of Louis.</p>

<p>During this time of disorder the nobles had
gradually succeeded in drawing into their power
many of the royal fortresses; and, the central
authority being thus fatally weakened, robbery and
violence prevailed throughout the country. Poor
Elizabeth ventured back to Prague about 1325;
and she used her best efforts for the good of her
country. On the occasion of a plague, she arranged
processions in which sacred relics of great value were
publicly exhibited; she endowed monasteries, and
protected them, even with a high hand, against the
intrusions of the nobles; while, for her personal consolation,
she contemplated a thorn from the Sacred
Crown, which King Charles of France had sent her
as a present during some of the revels which her
husband was enjoying at Paris.</p>

<p>Bishop John of Prague might have given her some
help in the government of the country; but he was
summoned to Avignon to be tried as a protector of
heretics, and detained there for thirteen years before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
he was tried and acquitted. It was impossible, however,
to expect that either the queen or the bishop
could hold their own against such men as Henry of
Lipa; and, after the death of the queen in 1330, even
King John began gradually to realise that some
better provision must be made for the government of
the country. So, three years later, he consented to
send his eldest son, who had hitherto been detained
at Paris, to try his hand at the restoration of order in
Bohemia.</p>

<p>This son had originally been named Wenceslaus,
at the time when John was still hoping to conciliate
the national feeling of Bohemia; but he had subsequently
been re-named Charles, in honour of John’s
model and ally, the King of France. He was now
seventeen years old; he was welcomed by the
Bohemians as the son of their beloved Elizabeth, and
his dignified and straightforward manners tended to
increase the attachment of his subjects. He speedily
showed that enthusiasm for his mother’s country
which was to produce such striking results, when
once his hand was free. By judicious economy, he
tried to buy back for the Crown those castles which
had been mortgaged to the nobles; and he made
progresses through his dominions, hearing the grievances
of the people and trying to redress them.
This policy did not suit those disorderly nobles who
had hitherto ruled at their pleasure. They easily
succeeded in stirring up John’s suspicions against
his son, as they had previously done against his wife;
and Charles was deprived of his power and sent off
to the Tyrol. Not many years elapsed, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
before John discovered that his son would be still
necessary to him, if he wished to gain any advantage
from the kingdom of Bohemia. But Charles had now
realised that his father was habitually sacrificing the
honour and freedom of the country for the sake of
his own pleasures; and in 1342 the young prince
declared that he would only undertake the government
of Bohemia if John would consent to stay away
from it for two years, and would be content with the
sum of five thousand marks during that period.</p>

<p>The popular feeling in Bohemia was strongly in
favour of Charles, as against his father. Indeed, so
hated had the latter become, that, when he was shortly
after afflicted with blindness, many Bohemians considered
that this suffering was a judgment upon him
for his cruelty and oppression. He therefore considered
it advisable to accept these terms; and
Charles’s position was made still easier by the
friendship of Pope Clement VI., who, while anxious
to conciliate the friendship of John, was keenly
alive to the desirability of securing to his side the
national sentiment of Bohemia. He therefore raised
the Church of Prague into an archbishopric, emancipating
it entirely from the archbishopric of Mainz;
and he also conceded that often disputed demand for
the use of the Slavonic ritual in the monasteries of
Bohemia.</p>

<p>Indeed, both John and Clement had a very special
reason for desiring to keep the popular young prince
in friendly alliance with them. The ambition, which
John had once cherished on his own behalf, had now
been turned into a desire for the exaltation of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
son. For different reasons both the King and the
Pope were now eager for the overthrow of Louis of
Bavaria; and they heartily agreed that Charles was
the most hopeful candidate for the Imperial throne.
The other Electors were equally ready for this
change; and in July, 1346, Charles was chosen
Holy Roman Emperor. Such a step could not long
fail to produce dangerous results; but, before the
opponents of the new Emperor were prepared for
action, the attention of Europe was distracted from
their quarrels by a war between England and France.
John eagerly rushed to the support of his old ally;
and, in August, 1346, he died fighting at the battle
of Crecy&mdash;a death much admired by the readers of
romances, and an infinite relief to the oppressed
Bohemians.</p>

<h2>VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">REIGN OF CHARLES IV.<br />
(1346-1378.)</span></h2>

<p>In writing the life of men who have played a great
part in the affairs of the world, it is generally possible
to find some hint in the earlier periods of their life of
a preparation for the important work which has distinguished
their later years. In the case of Charles
IV. this link seems at first sight exceptionally difficult
to find. He had been torn away from his
mother’s influence in his earliest childhood; treated
with exceptional harshness, at that tender age, by his
father; kept away so long from the country which
he was afterwards to govern, that when he first returned
to it he had completely forgotten the Bohemian
language; suddenly thrust into a partial
government of the country, at the age of seventeen;
regarded by his father and those who surrounded
him with the utmost suspicion, and snatched away
from the government when he was just beginning
to get a firm hold of it. Then he was dragged into
Italian wars with which he had little sympathy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
where men seemed to fight as much with poison as
with swords; a witness of his father’s dissolute life,
and surrounded by evil companions; and, to crown
all his difficulties, when he had attained to full manhood,
but had not yet become king of Bohemia, he
had been suddenly raised to the highest dignity in
Europe. Such was the preparation which Charles
had received for the government of a kingdom which
required special knowledge, special sympathies, and
somewhat exclusive care.</p>

<p class="caption">Karl IV. mit der Kaiserin Anna.</p>

<p class="caption">LIKENESS TAKEN FROM CHAPEL IN CARLSTEIN.</p>

</div>

<p>But in the fragment of autobiography which Charles
has left us, he has himself supplied the clue to at
least some part of this difficulty. That residence in
Paris, and intimacy with the King of France, which
was to John merely a new opportunity for self-indulgence
and luxury, gave to Charles both that
interest in the higher education of a people which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
was of so much service to Bohemia, and a personal
zeal for study which doubtless saved him from many
of the evils which surrounded him. The King of
France took a great fancy to his young namesake;
and, though he and most of his family were ignorant
of literature, he saw the value of it for others, and
urged his chaplain to encourage Charles in his studies.
Paris was at that time the centre of learning. It
contained the most completely organised University,
except that of Bologna; and it attracted students
from many parts of Europe. The influence of the
king’s chaplain doubtless developed in Charles that
reverence for the clergy and the pope which was,
perhaps, more of a real moral conviction in him than
in any prince of his time. He was also fortunate in
the ease with which he acquired new languages; and
this gift enabled him to recover his power of speaking
Bohemian without losing his knowledge of German.
Whence he could have derived that intense Bohemian
feeling, which showed itself in all the more
important acts of his life, sometimes even to the
prejudice of his work as German Emperor, it is very
difficult to say; but, doubtless, the fervent and
practical piety, which always distinguished him, led
him to cling to such traditions as he could gather
about the mother of whom he had seen so little; and
the zeal for her country, when he saw the wrongs
inflicted on it by his father, would have been
quickened in him by that hatred of injustice and
oppression which was so strong an element in his
character. But, be the causes what they may,
certain it is that the first important use which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
made of his double power of Bohemian king and
German emperor was to lay the foundations of a
scheme for making Prague the intellectual centre,
not only of Bohemia, but of the whole Empire.</p>

<p>In Bohemia, as elsewhere, book-learning had
primarily been considered as part of the training of
the clergy. Under Ottakar II., indeed, an attempt
had been made to enlarge the range of studies, and
perhaps to interest in them people of other professions
and races. But, after the fall of Ottakar,
Rudolf had feared anything which would attract his
Austrian subjects to Bohemia; and the Austrian
students had been ordered to leave Prague. Wenceslaus
II. had tried to revive and develop his
father’s ideas; but, as it was not even then understood
that a University could be intended for all
men, the nobles successfully opposed the scheme, as
an attempt to increase the power of the clergy.</p>

<p>Charles soon showed that, while anxious to work
with the clergy in this, as in other matters, he yet
aimed at something much higher and wider than a
mere clerical school. Doctors of law, medicine, and
natural science were summoned to join in his new
institution; and the Faculties were organised, partly
on the model of Paris and partly of Bologna. The
Rector, who was elected by masters and students,
was the chief judge of the University; but, in the
matters which purely related to their own art or
science, the elected heads of the Faculties were left
to manage their own affairs. Important as the
lectures at the University were considered, a great
deal of the instruction was conveyed through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
medium of public discussions, in some of which all
the Masters of Arts were compelled to take part.
Questions of the alterations of the Statutes were
decided by a general assembly, in which masters
and students had equal votes.</p>

<p>But one of the most distinctive points of Charles’s
scheme, and one which produced most important
effects both for good and evil, was the division of
the University into four Nations. These were called
respectively the Bohemian, Bavarian, Polish, and
Saxon. The Bohemian Nation included Hungary;
the Bavarian, most of South Germany; the Polish,
Prussia and Silesia; and the Saxon, all the rest of
North Germany, with Denmark and Sweden. Each
of these Nations chose one Elector; the four Electors
chose seven others; the seven chose five; and then
these five chose the Rector of the University. For
special cases, not dealt with by the general assembly,
a council of eight was appointed, containing
two representatives from each Nation. How much
Charles desired to make his University a centre for
the whole Empire may be gathered from the fact
that among the first eight professors one was a
Saxon, one a Westphalian, and one a Frenchman.
The tendency to welcome men of learning was
characteristic of Charles’s reign; nor was his welcome
confined to teachers and writers; artists also
shared his patronage; and his reign was marked
by efforts after external splendour and stern morality
which are seldom found in combination. The most
remarkable outward symbol of these divergent
tendencies is the celebrated fortress of Carlstein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
(Karluv Tyn, Charles’s town), which, in its form,
its decoration, and special objects, seems to combine
the memories of Charles’s work as king, as moral
reformer, and as patron of Art. Devised for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
better protection of the crown jewels, and, at a
somewhat later period, of the charters of Bohemia,
it also afforded a place of retirement for periods
of strict and almost ascetic devotion; while the
pictures on its walls, and the precious stones which
cover its roof, recall the memory of the encouragement
which the King gave to the Arts of his time.</p>

<p class="caption">CARLSTEIN (KARLUV TYN).</p>

</div>

<p>But the attempt to combine his work as Emperor
with his work as King of Bohemia was to be the
great difficulty of his career; and scarcely had he
succeeded in bringing the University into working
order before the great rush of students began to
alarm the inhabitants of Prague. Complaints were
made of disorders, of the high price of provisions,
and of difficulties arising from the want of accommodation
in the city. This last objection Charles
proceeded to meet by founding a new suburb of
Prague, to be united by ditch, wall, and bridge with
the old city, and to enjoy the same privileges as the
rest of Prague. This helped forward Charles’s plans
for raising Prague into Imperial importance; and the
work of uniting all the different parts of the city was
undertaken on so splendid a scale that, in a time of
famine, Charles was able to solve “the problem of
the unemployed,” by setting more than a thousand
men to work on the new walls. But there still
remained the disorders which had been brought
about by the arrival of German students, who distrusted
the justice of Bohemian tribunals. In order
to restore peace, Charles placed the University
directly under his own authority, and allowed no
appeal from the decisions of the Rector, except to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the highest court. This creation of an independent
corporation of learning was a necessary stage in
the growth of the University, and contained seeds
both of good and evil, to be developed at a later
time.</p>

<p>In the founding of this University, Charles had
aimed at the accomplishment of two different objects;
the establishment of an intellectual centre for the
Empire, and the development of a new life in Bohemia.
The second of these objects was probably the one
nearest to his heart; and it was not only by the
encouragement of learning that he hoped to promote
it, but by attention to every phase of national well-being.
He, like his grandfather Wenceslaus, desired
to substitute a written code of laws for the floating
mass of customs and traditions by which Bohemia
was, in great part, governed. How far Wenceslaus
had gone towards the execution of this plan cannot
be ascertained; but Charles actually drew up his
code, and gave it the name of the Majestas Carolina.
If we may judge from his preface, and from the
subject which stands first in the code, the cause of
oppression and disorder which most impressed him
in Bohemia was the alienation of royal lands by the
Kings. The power which special nobles had gained,
through these grants, had been often used in a most
disorderly manner. The efficiency of the central
Executive had been unduly weakened; and an excuse
had been given for those continual demands for exceptional
taxation, which had so painfully marked
the reign of King John. Charles therefore drew up
a careful list of the cities and lands, which, under no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
circumstances, should be alienated by the King, nor
should any grant of them be asked for by others.
Special arrangements were made for the registration,
in a public court, of lands sold by the nobles; lands
were not to be granted to the “dead hand”; special
means of remedy were to be provided against oppression
by the King; special restrictions were to be
placed on the power of nobles over their dependants.
Other provisions of various importance were contained
in this document; but the great, and essential,
point about it was, that these “Constitutions” were to
be read four times a year in Bohemia, before a full
assembly of the people, that all might know the laws
by which they were governed.</p>

<p class="caption">MAPS SHOWING GROWTH OF PRAGUE UNDER CHARLES IV.</p>

</div>

<p>This provision pointed to Charles’s chief object in
composing the Code; and it was doubtless this very
demand which roused to its height the opposition of
the nobles. It was not merely this or that privilege
which the King was threatening; it was the whole
fabric of feudal power, which depended much more
on the separate and individual influence of each noble
on his estate, than on any decrees of a collective
Assembly; and this influence must necessarily give
way before a code of written law, set forth by the
King, and accepted and supported by the main body
of the people.</p>

<p>Charles was no “benevolent despot,” determined to
thrust upon his people, by force, principles of government
for which they were not prepared. He yielded
to the resistance of the nobles, and withdrew the main
part of the Majestas Carolina. The concession was
undoubtedly a wise one; and, however excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
were many of the changes which he had proposed,
there were parts of this remarkable document which
make one glad that they were not stereotyped in a
code, nor sanctified in the memories of Bohemians by
so close a connection with their popular king. Thus,
for instance, Charles opens his code with a strong
declaration of devotion to the Catholic faith, with a
prohibition to Pagans and Saracens against settling
in Bohemia, and with a promise to put down heresy
with the sword.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Again, the declaration of the power
of lords over their dependants is only limited by
taking from the lords the right of putting out their
eyes or cutting off their hands and feet; and though
Charles, no doubt, was thinking more of these limitations
than of the power which he still left to the
nobles; yet it was obvious that such a statement in
a code might be used in the very opposite sense to
that in which it was written. That is to say, the
code might have been appealed to in later times as
securing to the nobles all the powers of which it did
not expressly deprive them.</p>

<p>But Charles had the statesmanlike instinct which
tells a man when to yield and when to stand firm.
There was one reform on which he was determined,
and which he insisted on carrying out in spite of the
opposition of the nobles. This was the abolition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
those supposed tests of justice, by which accused
persons were compelled to hold, or to walk upon,
burning iron, or to prove their innocence by risking
drowning. We are so apt to consider these superstitions
as bound up with old religious feelings, that we
almost instinctively expect to find this kind of abuse
supported by the pious and orthodox in those generations,
and opposed chiefly by some coldly superior
persons who are untouched by the popular feeling of
the time. But nothing is clearer than that Charles
was stirred to this great reform by an intense sense of
piety and reverence. Witness the words by which he
had preluded this reform in the Majestas Carolina.
“For he who should presume to tempt the omnipotence
of God, and to make ridiculous His secret
judgment, by forcing his neighbour to perish by
means contrary to nature, does not deserve to enjoy
the comfort of his own natural life.” In this reform
he was steadily supported by Archbishop Arnestus;
and, in spite of the opposition of the nobles, he succeeded
in getting these terrible abuses suppressed.
With regard to the ordeal by battle he was less
successful. Indeed he was apparently disposed to
accept a rather curious compromise on the subject.
Duelling of all kinds he loathed as disorderly; but,
in the case of charges of treason, he permitted a
prosecutor who could bring nine respectable witnesses
to support his charge, to make good his accusation
by the final test of the duel. It does not appear,
however, that he succeeded in reducing this foolish
practice even within these limits.</p>

<p>Lastly, and perhaps best of all, he secured to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
peasantry the right of appealing to the King from the
feudal courts of their lords. Doubtless the readiness
of the nobles to accept this important reform was
much increased by Charles’s willingness to do justice
as against himself. Thus, in a dispute with some
nobles about the possession of a certain castle, he
consented to submit the question to two Bohemian
nobles chosen for the purpose; and he abode by the
compromise which they suggested.</p>

<p>In short, in his position as King of Bohemia, Charles
generally appears as one of those exceptional rulers
who combine a genuine zeal for reform with a real
sense of justice, and that statesmanlike self-restraint
which teaches a man the difference between the desirable
and the possible, between the ultimate ideal and
the immediately practicable. But it is impossible to
separate Charles the Emperor from Charles the King
of Bohemia. Many of his greatest reforms, such as the
establishment of the University and the assertion of
the independence of the Prague archbishopric, could
not have been carried out so easily, perhaps not at all,
unless he had been able to use his authority as
Emperor to back his power as King of Bohemia, and
to secure also the sympathy and approval of the
Pope. So thoroughly was the connection of his
Imperial office with his Bohemian kingship recognised
by his subjects, that it is the rarest thing to find this
popular King mentioned in the chronicles by his
proper Bohemian title of Charles I., still less by his
early name of Wenceslaus. The <i>Emperor</i> Charles IV.
has overshadowed and absorbed Wenceslaus alias
Charles I. of Bohemia; and yet so far was he from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
losing thereby the sympathies of the Bohemians, that
it is they and not the Germans who cherish his
memory as that of a great and popular ruler.</p>

<p>The German view, indeed, is more nearly represented
by the saying of Maximilian I., “Charles was the
father of Bohemia, but the stepfather of the Holy
Roman Empire.” This saying, like most epigrams
that have lived, has a mixture of truth and falsehood.
Certainly one of the morals of Charles’s career might
seem to be the impossibility of combining these two
important offices in a manner which should satisfy
the just demands both of Germans and Bohemians.
But though, as will presently appear, the weaker and
worse part of his policy was connected with his position
as Emperor, yet there is evident, even in his plans
for Germany, a real enthusiasm for order, good
government, and, above all, independence of that
Papal power which had paralysed German progress.</p>

<p>The Golden Bull, with which his name is specially
connected, shows in many respects these noble aims.
The disorderly state into which the Empire had
fallen had been largely due to the uncertainty of the
Electorate. The titles which carried with them a
right of voting for the Emperor, had been so often
shared by different claimants, and the lands which
originally marked these titles had been so often
divided, that few could tell who had really the right
of choosing the ruler of Europe; while the irregularity
of many elections had given opportunity for the assertion
of spurious claims, like those of the Dukes of
Bavaria. Charles fixed the Electorate on a clear
basis, and settled the lands which gave the right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
voting. He also sternly prohibited those private
feuds which had done such evil in Germany. Lastly,
he boldly asserted the right of the Electors to choose
the Emperor, without waiting for confirmation of their
choice by the Pope. But, at the same time, he
secured for the King of Bohemia the leading position
among the Electors of the Empire; he declared his
independence of the Imperial courts; and he asserted
the right of the Bohemians to choose their own king,
as soon as the House of Luxemburg was extinct.</p>

<p>Obviously there was here much to provoke opposition.
The smaller princes, fierce at the restriction
on their rights of quarrelling, broke into fresh disorders;
the dukes of Bavaria took up arms to
reassert their suppressed electoral rights; the dukes
of Austria were indignant that their claims to
the Bohemian succession, founded on the decree
passed in King Rudolf’s Assembly, were now definitely
repudiated. Charles dealt in different ways
with these sets of opponents. The turbulent rioters
he forcibly suppressed, but readily admitted to favour
when repentant. From Bavaria, however, he thought
it necessary to take stronger securities. After he
had defeated the Dukes in battle, he succeeded in
persuading them to sell to him lands and cities,
which he added to the kingdom of Bohemia, and
thereby extended that kingdom as far as Nürnberg.
It might be plausibly urged that Bohemia needed
securities for peace against so turbulent a neighbour
as Bavaria; but it was evident, from the additions
to his kingdom which Charles carried out at a later
time, that this was but part of his scheme for securing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to Bohemia that predominance in the Empire which
was hinted at in the Golden Bull. Bavaria and the
smaller princes being brought to reason, there remained
still the struggle with Austria. Here one
might have expected that the long-standing feud
between Bohemian and Austrian, and between the
House of Luxemburg and the House of Hapsburg,
would have made the contest deadly in its course
and crushing in its results. Strange to say, it ended
in a settlement which must, even at the time, have
startled some Bohemians, though no doubt they could
never have expected that the following century would
see the claim then legalised grow into practical results.
In consideration of the peaceable abandonment by
the House of Hapsburg of its immediate claims, it
was promised the succession to the throne of Bohemia
as soon as the direct lines of Charles and of his
brother John should have come to an end. In all
these matters Charles had shown a genuine desire
for peace and order, which must surely deserve all
recognition.</p>

<p>The same credit cannot be given to another phase
of his policy, which arose from his relations with
Louis, the son of his former rival, the Emperor Louis
of Bavaria. The causes of this quarrel must be shortly
told. John, the brother of Charles, had married
Margaretha Maultasche, Countess of Tyrol; and he
had thereby acquired her lands. Margaretha, who
seems to have been as foul in mind as she was ugly
in face, made a false charge of impotency against her
husband; and, under this excuse, she hastened to
welcome the advances of young Louis, the son of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Emperor, who helped her to drive her husband from
the Tyrol.</p>

<p>The Emperor recognised a so-called marriage between
his son and Margaretha; and this act contributed
not a little to the storm of indignation
which drove the Bavarian from the throne of the
Empire and raised Charles to his place. Charles was
scarcely seated on the throne, before he resolved to
revenge his brother by a raid on the Tyrol. The
raid produced no results but bloodshed and misery;
and John was forced to console himself for the loss
of his lands by the Margravate of Moravia, and for
the loss of Margaretha by marriage with a more
faithful wife.</p>

<p>But the quarrel between Charles and Louis was
not yet at an end. On the extinction of the line of
the former Margraves of Brandenburg, the territory
had been granted to Louis by his father, and he had
remained in undisturbed possession of it for several
years. Suddenly, in 1348, a claimant came forward
to the Margravate. This man declared that his name
was Waldemar; that he was son of the late Margrave
of Brandenburg; that, since 1319, he had been supposed
to be dead; that his death had been really
pretended, in order to escape from a marriage, which,
after its celebration, he had found to be illegal; and
lastly that, his wife being now dead, he had come
forward to claim his inheritance. The story was
sufficiently absurd; and it might have been thought
that, even if it were true, a prince who had pretended
to be dead for nearly thirty years, might, in the
interest of peace, consent to pretend a little longer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Charles’s excuse for crediting the imposture was that,
as he was too young to remember the real Waldemar,
he trusted in the evidence of the Duke of Saxony
and other princes of the Empire, who, after investigating
the case, declared their belief in the genuineness
of the claim. Encouraged by this evidence,
Charles only too gladly seized the opportunity for
avenging his brother. He declared war on Louis,
removed him from his Margravate, and established
Waldemar in his place. Eventually it was proved that
the so-called Waldemar was the subject and tool of
the Duke of Saxony; and Charles, convinced of the
imposture, was forced to reinstate Louis in Brandenburg.
But, his attention once fixed on this province,
he saw in it a new opportunity for aggrandising his
House and Kingdom; and, in restoring it to Louis,
he secured to his own son Wenceslaus the succession
to the Margravate.</p>

<p>But, if this unfortunate episode illustrates afresh
the dangers which Charles had to encounter in combining
his positions of German Emperor and Bohemian
King, there was at least one side of his policy for
which Germans, even more than Bohemians, have
cause to thank him. It has already been mentioned
that in the Golden Bull Charles had asserted
the right of the Electors of the Empire to choose
an Emperor without waiting for the confirmation of
the Pope. This bold proposal was connected with
that desire for a German rather than a Roman
Empire, which Rudolf of Hapsburg and other wise
rulers had cherished. Charles, as we shall see, had
no desire to weaken the Papacy in spiritual matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and he had been willing enough to go to Rome to be
formally crowned in the sacred city; but he wished
to free the German princes from that intolerable
burden of the rule over Italy which was always
involving the Emperors in useless expeditions, and at
the same time to prevent the Popes from interfering
in German affairs.</p>

<p>In his desire to escape from the burden of Italian
politics, Charles had to resist the pressure of two
advisers, each remarkable in his special way, and
each disposed to revive the memory of that expedition
to Italy, which Charles’s grandfather, Henry of
Luxemburg, had so rashly attempted. The interview
between the first of these advisers and the King must
have been most impressive. It was during a temporary
coolness between Charles and Pope Clement
VI., that Charles, while staying in his palace at
Prague, was informed that a merchant, who had
recently come to the city, desired to see him on
urgent business. The supposed merchant was admitted;
but when called on to state his business,
replied with the startling words, that he had been
sent to Charles by a hermit, to inform him that God
the Father and God the Son had hitherto ruled the
world; but that in future it would be ruled by the
Holy Spirit alone.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This formula was apparently
familiar to Charles, for he at once recognised the
speaker as the ex-tribune Rienzi. Rienzi, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
challenged, at once admitted his identity; then he
went on to give a sketch of the rise and fall of his
government in Rome, and urged Charles to send him
back to Rome as his representative. The strain of
mysticism in Rienzi’s language, coupled with the
Pope’s former warnings, alarmed the orthodox
Charles, and he sent at once for Archbishop Arnestus.
A few questions from Arnestus soon involved Rienzi
in statements which savoured of heresy. The archbishop
at once arrested him, and soon after sent him to
Avignon, where he was kept as a prisoner for some
time. Even from prison Rienzi appealed to Charles
for sympathy, on the ground that he was the illegitimate
son of the Emperor Henry, and therefore
Charles’s uncle. Charles replied that such a consideration
would not affect his action, as we all came
from Adam; and he urged Rienzi to think of his
soul, and not to listen to the friar, whose prophecies
would drag him to ruin. The end of Rienzi’s career
is well known; how, returning as Senator and Papal
representative to the city which he had formerly
governed in the name of the People, he was soon
after murdered by the Romans, whom he had tried
to restore to the “Good State.”</p>

<p>The other adviser, who tried to involve Charles in
the responsibilities of the government of Rome, was
a man of very different type. This was the poet
Petrarch, who had first been interested in Charles by
the admiration which the latter had expressed, during
a visit to Avignon, for the beautiful Laura. So good
a judge of beauty must, of course, be the poet’s ideal
ruler; and Petrarch was only too eager to play the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
part of Dante to the grandson of Henry of Luxemburg.
His first appeal to Charles was left unanswered;
but, after the fall of Rienzi, the poet
returned to the attack, and urged upon the Emperor
the duty of coming to Rome, and administering the
Holy Roman Empire from its capital. Charles had
heard much of Petrarch between the writing of these
two letters; and, admiring his graceful style, readily
entered into correspondence with him, and pointed
out to him the difficulties and dangers of the course
which he advised. Petrarch did not cease to urge
his proposal, and twice he fancied that his dream was
about to be realised; once, when Charles went to Rome
to be crowned by the Papal representative, and again,
at a later time, when he consented to escort the
Pope from Avignon to Rome, and even to compel
the Visconti to abandon their opposition to the Papal
claims over some of the northern towns of Italy.
But the first expedition was merely intended to
strengthen his throne by the kind of prestige which
the Papal approval was still supposed to give to it;
and the second visit was undertaken in the interests
of Italian order and Papal dignity. In short, though
Charles was anxious for Petrarch’s company, and
would have liked him to lecture on literature to the
University of Prague, and to the young Wenceslaus,
he had no intention of following the poet’s advice
in the weighty concerns of government.</p>

<p class="caption">STATUE OF CHARLES IV. NEAR HIS BRIDGE IN PRAGUE.</p>

</div>

<p>Before concluding this general sketch of Charles’s
career, it is necessary to refer to a project, the
character of which may be easily misunderstood.
Even when freed from Italian influence, and united,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
at least in intellectual interests, with Bohemia, the
German Empire might still be exposed to the disorders
arising from the contests of its princes,
especially at the time of the election of the Emperors.
This evil Charles proposed to remove by making the
Imperial crown hereditary in the House of Luxemburg.
One must not judge this scheme as a mere
piece of personal ambition. Doubtless there is always
something repugnant to our ideas of strict honesty
in those frequent attempts, during the Middle Ages,
to turn an elective position to the permanent advantage
of the family of its accidental occupant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
But we must remember that there is an important
difference between the purpose of Charles IV. and
other attempts which appear to have the same
character. When, for instance, Rudolf of Hapsburg
used his Imperial position to turn the Counts of
Hapsburg into Dukes of Austria; when the Margrave
of Brandenburg made use of his Mastership of the
Teutonic knights as a means of uniting East Prussia
with Brandenburg; or when the Savoyard Pope Felix
used his Papal power to extend the dominions of the
House of Savoy; none of these attempts could have
profited any one except the ambitious promoters of
them. But, if Charles could have made the German
Empire hereditary in a House which was already
powerful by its position in Bohemia, and could at the
same time have delivered it from the terrible encumbrance
of the connection with Italy, many a
bitter civil war might surely have been spared. His
attempt failed; and, from some points of view, one
may say that it was well that it failed. But a
great design cannot be completely judged by its
results alone.</p>

<h2>VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE REFORM MOVEMENT FROM THE DIET OF 1359
TO THE RETIREMENT OF THE GERMANS FROM
THE PRAGUE UNIVERSITY.<br />
(1359-1409.)</span></h2>

<p>Many causes had paved the way for that revolution,
both of thought and action, which marks the
fourteenth century. The complete failure of the
crusades had shaken the faith of the people generally
in the leadership of those princes and nobles who
had organised these expeditions. The insurrection
of “the Shepherds” in France had been one of the
first results of this feeling; while the extraordinary
performances of the Flagellants or Scourging Friars
showed yet more clearly the extravagances which the
popular discontent might produce.</p>

<p>Nor, in the general whirl of thought and feeling,
was it easy to foresee on which side any new development
of this feeling should be classed; whether it
should be condemned as a source of heresy and a
disturbance of order, or applauded as a revival of
stronger faith and stricter discipline. The Dominicans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and Franciscans, called into existence to combat
heresy and to strengthen the Papal power, were
looked upon by the secular clergy as intruders on
their lawful privileges and disturbers of the peace;
while the Franciscan renunciation of property gradually
led them on to the advocacy of doctrines, which
were at least as inconvenient to Popes and Cardinals
as to the secular nobles.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of the way in which anxiety
for their temporal possessions was colouring all the
feelings of the defenders of the Church, that, throughout
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the name
with which its champions were most eager to brand
their opponents, as indicating the darkest shade of
heresy, was the name of “Picard.” This word was a
corruption of “Beghard,” the title of a Flemish sect,
which had been distinguished for its devotion and
zeal for prayer, but which had alarmed the rulers
of the world by its advocacy of community of
goods.</p>

<p>The confusion produced in men’s minds by the
failure of the Church’s armies to recover Palestine,
was still further increased by the retirement of the
Popes to Avignon, and at a later time by that schism
in the Papacy which followed the restoration of the
Papal rule in Rome; and, along with the desire for the
re-establishment of the unity of the Church, there grew
the wish for a revival of peace and purity in the
general life of Europe.</p>

<p>Of all the rulers of the fourteenth century Charles
IV. seemed the most likely to guide these conflicting
movements into channels, which should be at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
favourable to the champions of the Papacy, and
welcome to the promoters of peace and purity.</p>

<p>As King of Bohemia he had inherited, through his
mother’s family, traditions of special devotion to the
Church; and most of the circumstances of his career
were of a kind to encourage the hopes of the Pope
and the clergy. He had been elected to the Imperial
throne, in opposition to the most bitterly anti-papal
of Emperors, Louis of Bavaria; he had steadily
opposed all the proposals which had been made to
him, to induce him to assert his Imperial authority
over the Italian cities; and he had prefaced the
Majestas Carolina with an assertion of his adherence
to the Catholic faith, and a denunciation of heresy.
No doubt that clause in the Golden Bull which
repudiated the necessity of a Papal sanction to the
election of an Emperor, had drawn a protest from
the Pope; but this error had surely been more than
compensated for, by the zeal which Charles had
shown for the restoration of the Pope to Rome, and
for the maintenance of the Papal authority in Italy.</p>

<p>It must, then, have been with a shock of painful
surprise that, in 1359, Pope Innocent VI. found
himself suddenly opposed by this orthodox champion
of the Church. The first cause of division had been
a demand of Charles, that the Pope would repeal
some decrees which hindered the Emperor from
reforming the discipline of the clergy. Innocent had
been so indignant at this demand, that he had tried
to rouse the Electors against the Emperor; but he
had wholly failed in that attempt, and had been
forced to make some concessions to Charles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The next point of difference was connected with a
yet more burning question. Innocent had demanded
new tithes from the princes of the Empire. Many of
them had refused; and now, at an Assembly at
Mainz, the Papal Legate again raised the question,
possibly hoping to obtain Charles’s support. But the
Emperor answered his demand by an expression of
surprise, that the Pope was so much more zealous
for collecting money than for reforming the morals
of the clergy. Then, turning suddenly to the Dean of
Mainz, who was wearing a splendid silken robe ornamented
with gold, he made him exchange the magnificent
dress for the simple cloth robe which Charles
himself wore; and, as he put on the grand dress of
the ecclesiastic, he appealed to the spectators to say
if he did not now look more like a knight than a
dean. This practical exhibition of clerical luxury the
Emperor followed by a stern rebuke to the bishops
for not enforcing a more strict decorum of life among
the clergy; and he even threatened to tax their
income for the support of the royal exchequer.</p>

<p>In Germany, unfortunately, there were many
nobles who were ready to take advantage of the
reforming movement to promote their own ends.
That the clergy should live more simply seemed to
these nobles a most desirable thing; and to help
them to attain so satisfactory a condition, they proceeded
to plunder their houses, and lay waste their
lands. Such acts were utterly opposed to Charles’s
intentions; and he checked these outrages so sternly
that the Pope was once more forced to recognise him
as his safest and strongest supporter. Perhaps this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
last circumstance made it easier for Charles to carry
out his plans for reformation in Bohemia. In that
kingdom, however, he worked by different methods,
and with somewhat different objects from those at
which he had aimed in his German schemes of
reformation; for in Bohemia he trusted rather to
the moral effect which could be produced by great
preachers than to legislation or forcible repression.</p>

<p>The first of these preachers, whom the King
summoned to Prague, was an Austrian named
Conrad Waldhauser, who began to come prominently
forward in 1360, the year after Charles’s attempt to
reform the German clergy. Conrad’s preachings were
largely directed against the luxury of women; but he
also denounced the tyranny of the nobles and their
usurious exactions from the peasantry. His fiercest
attacks, however, were aimed against the Mendicant
Orders, and specially against their simoniacal attempts
to obtain ecclesiastical offices. It was these
attacks that brought the greatest danger to the
preacher; for the Franciscans were still strong in
Papal support; and Conrad was summoned before
the Legate to answer a charge of heresy. As both
King and Archbishop stood by the accused, the attempts
of his enemies were defeated; and he continued
till his death in 1369 to exercise great
influence in Bohemia.</p>

<p>But Conrad was a German, and preached, of
course, in his native language; and Charles felt
that, if the reformation were really to take hold of
the people, they must be addressed in their own
language. He therefore brought forward a preacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of a rather different type from Conrad. This was
Milic of Kromĕr̆íz̆, a Moravian of rather plebeian
origin. He had early attracted Charles’s attention,
and had been already appointed to some office about
the court in 1350. He had risen steadily in the
king’s favour, and had been raised in 1363 to one
of the chief posts in the Chancellery. An ascetic
dislike to worldly honours now induced him to resign
all these offices, in order to become a preacher. He
at first retired to a living in a distant town; but,
finding that the beautiful garden which was attached
to the pastor’s house gave him too much pleasure, he
returned to Prague, and began to preach at the Church
of St. Nicholas in the Small District, and afterwards
at St. Giles’s in the Old Town.</p>

<p>At first his Moravian accent excited some ridicule;
but the eloquence and moral fervour of his preaching
soon brought him large audiences; and he was at
last called on to preach three times a day in different
places. His horror at the evils of the time was so
great that he soon began to prophesy the coming of
Antichrist; and, at one time, when Charles was, as
he considered, falling short of his duty, Milic even
denounced the King as Antichrist. The Archbishop
of Prague became alarmed at this attack, and put
Milic in prison; but Charles himself never resented
the opposition of those whom he respected; and
Milic was set free again. Like so many of the
reformers of the time, he had been greatly distressed
at the retirement of the popes to Avignon; and,
when Charles was trying to persuade Pope Urban V.
to return to Rome, Milic went to Rome, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
also delivered his sermons on the coming of Antichrist.
The Roman authorities were alarmed, and
Milic was again thrown into prison; but, when the
Pope actually returned to Rome, he was again set
free and sent back to Prague.</p>

<p>He now abandoned his preaching on Antichrist,
and restricted it to the advocacy of moral reforms.
The death of Conrad Waldhauser made Milic the
undisputed leader among the preachers of Prague;
and, while the Teyn Church became the chief scene
of his labours, he also prepared discourses for a
preacher in another church. His most successful
work was in reclaiming fallen women. Of these he
had sometimes more than three hundred under his
charge, whom he had rescued from an evil life; and
he not only built a penitentiary for their residence,
but he persuaded the ladies of Prague to give them
places in their service. Charles nobly seconded his
efforts by pulling down a notorious house of ill-fame,
and building a church on the site of it.</p>

<p>But Milic’s fierce denunciations of the sins of the
clergy continued to stir up enemies against him;
and in 1374 Gregory XI., who had returned to
Avignon, sent a warning to the King and Archbishop,
as well as to the Bishops of Breslau, Cracow, and
Olmütz against the danger of Milic’s teaching. He
went to Avignon to defend himself; but, though he
succeeded in satisfying the Pope and cardinals of
his innocence, he never returned to Bohemia; for he
was seized with an illness while at Avignon, and died
there on St. Peter’s Day, 1374.</p>

<p>Milic had been assisted by his humble origin in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
gaining the sympathies of the poor; but even more
alarming to the Germans who had gathered in
Prague was Milic’s follower Thomas of S̆títný. He
was descended from a noble family, and had been
one of the earliest pupils of the University of Prague.
He was thus able to give a more permanent literary
reform to the teachings of the reformers. Nor did
he confine himself, as Conrad and Milic had done,
to efforts after moral improvement; for he grappled
also with those more subtle questions of theology
which were coming at that time into prominence.
Master Eckhard, the founder of the Mystics, had
been appointed at one time as Vicar-General of
Bohemia. He had no doubt gained considerable
influence in that country; and S̆títný’s utterances,
especially about Faith and Love, were coloured by
the teaching of the mystical school.</p>

<p>But the chief point of objection urged against
S̆títný by his enemies was that he wrote in Bohemian.
Since the time of Otto of Brandenburg, the
German language had gained much ground in the
town councils of Bohemia; and the foundation of
the Prague University had brought a rush of German
scholars to that city. The arrangements for the
votings of the Nations had secured a predominance
to the German element in the University; for not
only did the Bavarian and Saxon nations represent
almost exclusively the German influence; but even
in the districts from which the Polish nation was
drawn, there was a large German admixture. Of
course those students who had come from a great
distance had given a special proof of their genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
interest in learning; and they naturally looked upon
themselves as the representatives of a higher culture
than that of the ordinary townsfolk of Prague.
Hence it came that the leading doctors of the
University inclined to consider German rather than
Bohemian as the suitable language for men of
culture, especially when writing on abstruse subjects;
and this feeling they were all the more anxious to
assert, because, in the general stir of thought, a
native Bohemian literature was beginning to attract
attention.</p>

<p>Charles himself had studied the language carefully,
had favoured the revival of the Slavonic ritual, and,
as already mentioned, had chosen Milic of Kromĕr̆íz̆
in order to encourage the popular preaching of Bohemian.
Under these circumstances, satirists, poets,
and historians began to write in their native language;
and the Masters of the University felt that they
would have a hard struggle before they could denationalise
Bohemia. They were therefore especially
irritated when a cultivated nobleman like S̆títný
insisted on discussing the most profound and subtle
questions of theology in the Bohemian language;
and this alarm was certainly not diminished when
they found that he coupled these speculations with
denunciations of the corruptions of the clergy, the
tyrannies of nobles, and even the injustices of
kings. Thus, then, a general movement for the
reform of morals and the improvement of the clergy
was more and more connecting itself with the
struggles between German and Bohemian for the
supremacy of their respective languages. It is conceivable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that even so bitter a controversy as this
might have been guided into more peaceable channels
by a king who combined zeal for the Church, hearty
appreciation of German learning, and a real enthusiasm
for Bohemian traditions. But whether or not
Charles would have been equal to such a task, there
can be little doubt that his death in 1378, and the
accession of his son Wenceslaus IV., did prepare the
way for the more violent explosion which followed.</p>

<p>A great name is, in any case, a very dangerous
inheritance; and when that inheritance implies an
obligation on the heir to carry out a great work begun
by his predecessor, the tradition generally involves
failure and disgrace. In Wenceslaus, as in so many
sons of great rulers, some of the qualities which
had secured his father’s success were conspicuously
wanting. Charles had known when to insist, and
when to abstain from insisting, on the reforms
which he had most at heart. He had known how
far to go in the punishment of offences, and when
to pardon graciously; above all, he had known how
to respect, and even to utilise, the abilities of honest
opponents. None of these lessons of statesmanship
could Wenceslaus ever learn; he was absolutely
without self-restraint or sense of proportion; and,
consequently, though his aims were generally those
of a wise and patriotic ruler, he frequently used the
methods of a cruel tyrant.</p>

<p>Yet, with all these grave defects, Wenceslaus was
far from being the unscrupulous and self-indulgent
monster which his enemies delighted to paint him.
In the early years of his reign his policy was wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and enlightened, though, even then, it was marked
occasionally by that hastiness and uncertainty which
belonged to his passionate temperament. But, in the
difficult position in which he was placed, every step
which he took was a dangerous one, and was certain
to encounter fierce opposition.</p>

<p>The first work which his Imperial position imposed
on him was the effort to restore order in the Church,
by putting an end to the divisions between the rival
Popes. In this point he wisely followed the policy
of his father, and supported the claims of Pope
Urban VI., who was actually living at Rome. The
assembly of German princes accepted the decision of
the Emperor; and at Prague he received the support
both of the University and the Archbishop. But a
difficulty at once arose. The Pope of Avignon was,
as a matter of course, supported by the King of
France; and the old traditions of the House of
Luxemburg were in favour of friendly relations with
the French kings. Greatly, therefore, to Urban’s
indignation, Wenceslaus insisted on renewing his
alliance with Charles in the next year to that in
which he had recognised Urban as pope; he also
refused to support that Pope in his quarrels with the
House of Anjou for the possession of Sicily; and an
even more vital cause of difference between Urban
and Wenceslaus was the determination of the King
to assert his authority over the clergy of Bohemia.</p>

<p>It was in these quarrels with his clergy that
Wenceslaus first showed that tendency to violent
methods, which undermined his own power and
inflicted great injury on the cause of Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
reformation. In 1385 he was involved in a
quarrel with the Dean of Breslau. It appeared
that a cask of beer sent to the dean by his brother
had been intercepted by the Town Council, on the
ground that no foreign beer should be admitted into
the town. The dean, therefore, laid an interdict upon
Breslau. Wenceslaus came to inquire into the matter,
and demanded that the religious services should be
celebrated, as long at least as he stayed in the town.
The dean refused; and thereupon Wenceslaus
banished the whole Chapter of Breslau from the
town for two years, and handed over a large part
of their property to the citizens.</p>

<p>But the most dangerous of his clerical enemies
was the Archbishop of Prague, John of Jenstein.
The Archbishop, himself of noble birth, had had a
quarrel with the Marshal of the Court about certain
rights of fishing on the Elbe; and, in asserting these
rights, he had destroyed a weir which the marshal
had made. Wenceslaus took the side of his official,
and demanded that the Archbishop should make
compensation. Jenstein refused; and Wenceslaus
thereupon confiscated his property. But these acts,
however arbitrary, might possibly have been forgotten,
had they not been followed by a more
celebrated quarrel.</p>

<p>In the year 1393 the Vice Chamberlain, who was
the chief judge of the royal law-court, had put to death
two priests. It is uncertain what their offences were;
but the Archbishop claimed them as under his jurisdiction,
and asserted that they should only have been
tried in his court. About the same time, the Archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
had wished to seize and punish certain Jews,
who, after being baptised as Christians, had relapsed
into Judaism. As the Jews were under the special
protection of the King’s court, the Vice Chamberlain
refused to surrender them to the Archbishop. For
these two acts of opposition to his power, the Archbishop
excommunicated the Vice Chamberlain, and
denounced him as a heretic. The King received this
news with great indignation; and his anger was still
further quickened by a more personal insult. Not
long before this time, he had recommended a special
favourite to a bishopric in Pomerania; but, as the
rulers of Pomerania had resisted the appointment,
Wenceslaus had been unable to establish his claim.
He was therefore resolved to endow a new bishopric
in Bohemia, to which his nominee could be appointed;
and the death of the abbot of a monastery in Prague
suggested to the King the advisability of suppressing
the monastery in order to obtain funds for the endowment
of his new bishopric. The Archbishop opposed
the creation of this bishopric as a diminution of his
own diocese; and he may very likely have considered
the suppression of the monastery as an act of injustice.
In defiance, therefore, of the King’s order, the Archbishop
directed the monks to proceed to the election
of a new abbot, which they accordingly did. Wenceslaus
hastened back to Prague in great indignation;
and the Archbishop fled to the Castle of Raudnice.
The King claimed this as a royal castle; and he therefore
considered the Archbishop’s flight thither as conclusive
proof of an organised conspiracy against the
royal authority. Finding that Jenstein would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
return to Prague, the king summoned before him the
two chief officials of the archbishopric, Puchnic, and
John Nepomuc. When they persistently refused to
give any evidence against the Archbishop, Wenceslaus
ordered them to be tortured. As they continued to
defy him, he had them burnt on the hand; and, at
last, fixing upon Nepomuc, either as the most defiant
or the most important of his victims, he ordered him
to be bound hand and foot, and thrown into the
Moldau.</p>

<p>This crime was to produce even greater triumphs
for the clerical party than those which had followed
the murder of Becket; and Wenceslaus seems to
have repented of it almost as soon as it was
committed. He set Puchnic free, and gave him
money compensation for his sufferings; and he
recalled Jenstein to Prague. The Archbishop came;
a sort of reconciliation was patched up, but its
unreality was evident from the first. Jenstein
secretly fled to Rome and demanded that the Pope
should lay an interdict on Bohemia. At the same
time all the clergy appealed to Sigismund, King of
Hungary, the brother of Wenceslaus, to come to
Bohemia to avenge their wrongs. Strange to say,
this second appeal was the only one which produced
a result. The new pope, Boniface IX., was eager to
obtain the support of Wenceslaus, and therefore took
his part against the Archbishop. Sigismund, on the
contrary, was always ready to plot against his brother;
and he easily found allies among the Bohemian
nobility.</p>

<p>For, though the offences of Wenceslaus against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
clergy had attracted the most attention, his injuries
to the secular nobles had been not less keenly felt.
In his desire to weaken the more powerful members
of the aristocracy, he had formed a private Council
among the small nobility and citizens; and, by their
help, he had opposed and counteracted the greater
nobles. He had further offended their sense of
dignity and decorum by playing the part of Haroun
Alraschid, and paying secret visits to the houses of his
various subjects, to discover any offences which might
have escaped the notice of the ordinary tribunals.
This conduct had made him so unpopular with the
nobles that, even before Sigismund’s intervention, they
had formed a conspiracy against him. The ostensible
leader of this conspiracy was the king’s cousin Jodok,
the Margrave of Moravia; but perhaps its most powerful
member was Henry of Rosenberg. This nobleman,
like so many of his time, was a distinguished patron
of literature and art; though his influence in such a
movement was no doubt due to the more material
considerations of his high rank, wide connections, and
large territorial influence.</p>

<p class="caption">KRUMOV, ONE OF THE CHIEF SEATS OF THE ROSENBERGS.</p>

</div>

<p>The Rosenbergs were the members of a very powerful
group of families called the Vítkovici, who were
the practical rulers of the south and south-east of
Bohemia. There they exercised an authority which
was little short of regal. They had bodies of soldiers
at their command; they coined money and built
fortresses at their pleasure. They professed to trace
their origin to the Italian family of the Orsini; and
they had played almost as important a part in the
thirteenth century as the Vrs̆ovici had played in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
earlier history of Bohemia. Of these Vítkovici the
Rosenbergs were the most important branch; and
their name shows that they had to a large extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Germanised themselves, even in the time of Ottakar.
They had strengthened their position in Bohemia by
founding towns and monasteries, planting woods, and
building churches; and their fishponds became so
important that the town of Prague was mainly
supplied from them. So deeply-rooted was their
power that the signs of its past greatness are
visible even at the present day, in the towns of
Krumov, Tr̆ebon̆, Prachatice, the monastery of
Hohenfurt, and the castle and village of Rosenberg.
It will easily be understood that the leader of so
powerful a clan would deeply resent such attempts as
those of Wenceslaus to infringe the privileges of the
nobility, and to call men of lower rank to his Councils.
Nor did the nobles rely solely on Bohemian
support. Jodok of Moravia had taken counsel with
the Duke of Austria and the Margrave of Meissen, who
were always ready for any opportunity of weakening
the Bohemian kingdom. Such a combination as
this would have been dangerous even to Charles; and
Wenceslaus was quite unable to stand against it.</p>

<p>The rebels were quickly ready for action; and in
the year 1394, as Wenceslaus was on his way to Prague,
he was seized by Jodok and his followers, and imprisoned
in the Castle of Prague. The demands of the insurgent
nobles were now formulated. They insisted that
Wenceslaus should leave them in possession of all
the fortresses that had been pledged to them, and
that he should appoint Jodok as his Viceroy in
Bohemia. Duke John of Görlitz, the youngest
brother of Wenceslaus, hastened to the rescue of
the king; and, though Jodok succeeded in carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
off his prisoner to Austria, John was welcomed
by the citizens of Prague, who swore to recognise him
as the administrator of the country till the King
should once more be at liberty to act.</p>

<p>In the meantime the princes of the Empire had
become indignant at the treatment of their Emperor;
and they persuaded the Duke of Austria to set him
free. Wenceslaus returned, embittered and suspicious,
to his kingdom; and his brother John soon found that
the position of liberator and peacemaker was a very
difficult one. The rebel nobles had fled to Austria,
whence they made raids upon their native country;
John attempted to make peace between the king and
the insurgents; but, when Wenceslaus found that John
had mistaken the extent of the powers entrusted to
him by the rebels, he accused his brother of deceiving
him, and deprived him of his vice-royalty. Many of
the citizens of Prague had become attached to John,
and they remonstrated against his deposition. Thereupon
Wenceslaus deposed all the members of the
Town Council, appointed a new Council in their
place, and then went through the town, accompanied
by an executioner, who cut off the heads of the King’s
leading opponents at the doors of their houses. In
his discontent with John, Wenceslaus now appealed
to his brother Sigismund. Sigismund came, and
John soon after died, not without suspicion of
poison. Sigismund at once persuaded Wenceslaus
to recognise him as his heir if he should die without
sons, to appoint a Council of the nobles, and to
promise not to introduce any changes in the government
without the consent of that Council.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The hollowness of the peace which followed was
very quickly seen. When Jodok came to see the
king at Carlstein in the same year, Wenceslaus was
so carried away by the recollection of his cousin’s
insults, that he had him arrested and imprisoned.
Then, suddenly remembering the treaty of peace,
he set him free again. But Jodok thought more of
his imprisonment than of his liberation; and, though
nominally reconciled, the King and the Margrave
remained enemies throughout life.</p>

<p>The Bohemian quarrels had, in the meantime, given
opportunity for the intrigues of Wenceslaus’s rivals in
the Empire. That jealousy which the Electors always
felt of the concentration of the Imperial power in any
one family, had been for some time directed against
the House of Luxemburg. Charles’s extension of
Bohemian territory, by the addition of German
lands, had caused much suspicion and dislike. But
his combination of vigour and self-restraint, and his
complete hold over his Bohemian subjects, had prevented
the intriguers from making any head during
his lifetime. Now, however, the quarrels of Wenceslaus
with his subjects had given a double opportunity
to his German opponents; for while, on the one hand,
they could point to his long detention in Bohemia as
a proof of his indifference to Imperial affairs, on the
other hand, the disaffection of his Bohemian subjects
supplied a hopeful weapon for undermining his power.</p>

<p>His two leading enemies were Rupert, Count
Palatine of the Rhine, who aimed at the Imperial
dignity, and the Archbishop of Mainz, who had
secured his see by a promise to support the intrigues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of Rupert. These conspirators succeeded in winning
to their side Pope Boniface IX. This Pope had
indeed been at first friendly to Wenceslaus; but he
had been offended by the readiness with which the
King of Bohemia had listened to the French proposals
for the election of a new Pope in place of the two
rival claimants to the Holy See. Under various
pretexts, the Duke of Saxony and the Archbishops
of Trier and Köln were drawn into the conspiracy;
and so, in February, 1400, the Electors met at Frankfort
and resolved to choose a new Emperor.</p>

<p>The most plausible grounds for this deposition
were mainly of a negative kind. Wenceslaus was
charged with failing to procure a peaceful settlement
of the affairs of the Church, and with paying no heed
to those wars which were disturbing the Empire.
Though Wenceslaus might have found ample excuse
for these failures, he could not directly deny them;
but the other charges were either false or grossly
exaggerated. One of them, however, must be quoted,
since it has so much bearing on the troubles which
were approaching in the Bohemian kingdom. This
was a charge that he “had drowned, burnt, and otherwise
murdered and tortured reverend prelates and
priests.” This accusation shows that the murder of
Nepomuc was to be represented, at the pleasure of
Wenceslaus’s enemies, either as part of a general
massacre of priests, or as the cruel execution of one
specially righteous man.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, as the champion of Holy Church
against its oppressor, that Rupert was chosen Holy
Roman Emperor. In this character he at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
marched into Bohemia and won the support of Jodok
and the discontented nobles. Again Wenceslaus was
forced to make terms with his enemies; and again
Sigismund was called in and appointed Viceroy. But
Sigismund gained favour with no party. Jodok and
his friends resented the power entrusted to him; the
citizens of Bohemia complained of the heavy taxes
which he laid upon them; and Wenceslaus resisted
his proposal that he should counteract the schemes of
Rupert by accompanying Sigismund to Rome, and
by accepting the Imperial crown from the Pope.
Finding his plans thwarted, Sigismund suddenly
seized upon his brother, and carried him off as
prisoner to Vienna. From this imprisonment
Wenceslaus succeeded in escaping in 1403; and, on
his return to Prague, he was welcomed as the liberator
of Bohemia from Sigismund.</p>

<p>In the meantime the reform movement had been
approaching a crisis. The teacher who, after the
death of Milic, had gained most influence in the
country, was a Bohemian nobleman named Matthias
of Janov. He had not devoted himself so exclusively
as Conrad and Milic had done to the denunciation
of moral abuses, but had also attacked practices like
the worship of images and saints; and he had been
the first to bring before the public the question which
was afterwards to be so interesting to Bohemians, the
granting of the cup to the laity in the Holy Communion.
But though this latter fact gives Matthias a
kind of historic interest, he seems to have been in the
main a source of weakness to the cause which he
defended. Never wholly disinterested in his objects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
he soon flinched from the attacks of the rulers of the
Church; and in 1389 he formally recanted his reforming
doctrines.</p>

</div>

<p>Along with the movement for ecclesiastical reform,
the Bohemian national revival had been steadily
making way; and the opposition of the German party
had served to deepen the zeal of the reformers for the
encouragement of the Bohemian languages. A most
important link was formed in 1396 between the
linguistic and the moral revival. In that year a man
named John of Milheim founded a chapel which was
to be entirely devoted to Bohemian preaching, in
order, as its founder expressed it, “that the Word of
God should not be fettered, and that Bohemian
preachers should not be obliged to go from house to
house.” The new foundation was to be called the
Bethlehem Chapel, and was to be consecrated to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Holy Innocents. Strange to say, the first three
preachers seem to have been somewhat hesitating
and uncertain in their tendencies; and it was not
till 1402 that the appointment of Jan Hus secured to
the Bethlehem Chapel a special position in the history
of Bohemia.</p>

<p class="caption">HUSINEC, SHOWING COTTAGE WHERE HUS WAS BORN.</p>

</div>

<p>On July 6, 1369, Jan Hus was born at Husinec, in
the south of Bohemia. This village lies in a deep
valley among pine-covered hills, and the tiny cottage
in which Hus was born still remains. As his parents
were poor, he was forced to support himself in his
early days by singing in churches; and even after he
had been sent to the University he was in such straits
that he was at one time compelled to live on dry
bread. Nevertheless he made steady way in the
University; two years after taking his degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Master of Arts, he was appointed examiner; in 1401
he was elected Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and in
1403 he was chosen Rector of the University. He
had thrown himself from the first into the national
cause; and he denounced, from his pulpit in the
Bethlehem Chapel, the expedition of the rebel nobles
against Prague. He showed great zeal in giving new
literary expression to the Bohemian language, and
expunged from it the Germanisms which had crept
into it. He also persistently opposed the encroachments
of the Germans in the government of the
University. At the same time he always declared
that he would prefer a good German to a bad
Bohemian, even if the latter were his brother.</p>

<p>It was in this same year, 1403, that the national
reform movement began to connect itself generally
with questions of ritual and doctrine. The exact
point in history at which the doctrines of Wyclif
gained influence in Bohemia, is very difficult to fix.
The marriage of Anna, the sister of Wenceslaus, in
1381, to Richard II. of England, undoubtedly produced
close contact between the two countries. It is
clear, from his own statements, that Wyclif was much
impressed by the forwardness of the Bohemians in
religious knowledge, and specially by the fact that
they had already translated the Bible into their native
tongue. But, although this experience much affected
the work of the English Reformer, it seems doubtful
how soon he began to repay the debt, by imparting
his ideas to Bohemia. Apparently, neither Matthias of
Janov nor Thomas of S̆títný were deeply acquainted
with Wyclif’s works; and neither his condemnation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in 1382 nor his death in 1385 seem to have excited
much interest in Bohemia. Yet, on the other hand,
it is evident, from the scene which is about to be
described, that both Hus and some of his followers
must have given considerable attention to Wyclif’s
writings.</p>

<p>It was, however, the enemies of the English Reformer
who first publicly called the attention of the
Bohemians to his works. A German Silesian, named
Hubner, had selected from Wyclif’s writings forty-five
propositions which he asked the University of
Prague to condemn. The period of Hus’s Rectorship
seems to have come to an end before this proposal
was made; and on May 28, 1403, the new Rector of
the University convoked an assembly of the Masters
of Arts, and laid before them the propositions which
Hubner had compiled. Hus at once came forward to
answer Hubner, but he based his opposition entirely
on the inaccuracy of the summaries laid before them.
He referred to the burning alive of certain adulterators
of saffron, which had recently taken place in
Prague; and he declared that such a fate was better
deserved by these adulterators of books. But some of
his followers went much further. Stephen Pálec̆ threw
a book of Wyclif’s on the table, declaring that he was
willing to defend it against all attacks; and Stanislaus
of Znaym (Znojem) offered to prove that none of
the articles attributed to Wyclif were heretical. This
statement so offended some of the older Masters that
they at once left the room; but, in spite of their retirement,
a majority of those who remained condemned
the forty-five Articles of Wyclif, and decided that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
they should not be taught in Bohemia. The influence
of Wenceslaus was, for the moment, thrown on the
side of reform; and, after the death of the Archbishop
of Prague, he appointed to the see an ex-soldier
named Zbynĕk Zajíc, who had a great dislike to
many of the impostures which had been encouraged
by the clergy. The new Archbishop at once sent
Hus to inquire into several fictitious miracles which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
had recently become notorious in the country; and,
by his help, these abuses were checked for the time.</p>

<p class="caption">JAN HUS.</p>

</div>

<p>But, while Hus was zealous against every form of
moral corruption, he had by no means committed
himself to those doctrines for which Wyclif had been
branded as a heretic. At the same time he had read
and studied many of the purely philosophical works
of the English Reformer; and he expressed his
belief that much good was to be learned from them.
With the Englishman’s hatred of moral corruption
Hus sympathised yet more warmly; while the
national character of the two movements naturally
roused a sympathy between their respective supporters.
The revival of the English language, as a
literary expression of thought, had received considerable
impulse from Wyclif’s translation of the
Bible; and the use of English, rather than Latin or
Norman-French, in theological writings became one
of the notes of the Lollard movement. In this
tendency Hus could not fail to observe the likeness
to his own efforts to maintain the Bohemian language
against the inroads of the Germans.</p>

<p>All these considerations produced in Hus so strong
a personal admiration for Wyclif that he expressed
a wish that his soul might be with his. The combination
of such a wish with the rejection of many
of Wyclif’s doctrines as heretical, was utterly unintelligible
to most of the contemporaries of Hus. This
pious expression of moral sympathy was naturally
connected by many with the attacks which Stanislaus
of Znojem was at the same time making on the
doctrine of Transubstantiation; and, consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the rashness of Hus’s followers, coupled with his own
expressions of personal feeling, caused him to be
branded as a heretic, with regard to doctrines about
which he held the orthodox belief.</p>

<p>But the opposition to the reform movement could
not long be confined to the masters of the University
of Prague. In 1405 Pope Innocent VII. became
alarmed at the progress of heresy, and issued a Bull
against the doctrines of Wyclif. In deference to this
denunciation, Wenceslaus ordered an inquiry into
these doctrines; and Archbishop Zbynĕk became
even more excited on the subject. On May 14,
1408, even the Bohemian nation in the University
consented to hold a meeting for the examination of
Wyclif’s books; but they could only be induced to
come to the harmless conclusion that the Articles of
Wyclif should not be taught in any heretical sense,
and that his Dialogus and Trialogus should not be
studied by members of the University before they
had taken their degree. Such a decision could not
satisfy the Archbishop; and, in June, 1408, he issued
a new decree forbidding the clergy to preach against
Transubstantiation. This decree was soon followed
by a demand that all who possessed copies of Wyclif’s
books should surrender them to the Archbishop; and
the majority of the University obeyed this command,
only five students refusing.</p>

<p>Hus had openly expressed his dislike of some of
the prosecutions, by which the Archbishop attempted
to enforce some of his prohibitions; and such a protest
from so prominent a reformer could not be allowed
to pass unnoticed at such a crisis. So, early in 1408,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the clergy of Prague presented to the archbishop
certain articles against Hus. Most of these are concerned
with his denunciations of the pecuniary greed
of the clergy; but they also include a reference to
his wish that his soul might be with Wyclif. For
the moment, indeed, these complaints produced little
result; for just at this time Archbishop Zajíc himself
announced that, after inquiry, he could find no heresy
in Bohemia. Moreover, it was unavoidable that this
smaller controversy should be lost sight of, for a time,
in the apparently larger issue of the reunion of
Christendom under one Pope.</p>

<p>The division of the Papacy between Rome and
Avignon had begun to cause such a scandal in the
Church that a new Council was held necessary for
the restoration of order and unity. Wenceslaus saw
in the meeting of this Council an opportunity for
recovering the position of which he had been deprived.
He had never admitted the legality of his
deposition from the Imperial throne; and, since only
a part of the Electors had sanctioned that step, he
had plausible grounds for disputing its validity.
When, then, the Council of Pisa proposed to deal
with the Papal Schism, Wenceslaus consented to
send ambassadors to that Council, on condition that
they should be recognised as the representatives of
the Holy Roman Emperor. To secure the consent
of the Council to this proposal, Wenceslaus readily
accepted the decision of that body, that, as a preparatory
step to the Unity of the Church, the two
rival Popes should be required to resign; and he
forbade his subjects to recognise the authority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
either Gregory XII. or his rival till the Council should
have decided on their claims. This demand at once
produced a new line of division between the contending
parties in the Bohemian Church. Hus and
his friends had welcomed the Council of Pisa, as a
possible means of accomplishing the reforms which
they desired; and they made no difficulty about
approving the deposition of the two Popes. The
Archbishop, however, and the great body of the
Bohemian clergy, maintained that they were bound
by their allegiance to Gregory XII.; and in this view
the three foreign “Nations” in the University eagerly
supported them.</p>

<p>This division of opinion at once brought to a head
that desire for reasserting their national independence
which the Bohemians had so long cherished. The
dislike of being swamped in their own capital by
foreigners had been steadily growing in the minds of
the Bohemians. This feeling had been at first expressed
in complaints about the rise of prices and the
overcrowding of the city; but it had gained a much
greater intensity when the native population realised
that the supremacy of their language in their own
country was at stake. The resistance of the Germans
to the demands of Wenceslaus enabled the
Reformers to join their movement for national independence
with the assertion of the royal authority;
and, as a means of accomplishing both these ends,
they proposed that the Bohemian Nation should in
future have three votes in the election of University
officials, while each of the three foreign “Nations”
should be still limited to one vote. Wenceslaus had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
already made some concessions to the national party
in the University; and they naturally thought that he
would at once approve of a concession which would
tend to strengthen his hands in his struggle against
Gregory XII.</p>

<p>To their great surprise, however, they at first met
with a rebuff. Wenceslaus was desirous of recovering
his position as Emperor; and for that he needed
German support. He also wished to appear as the
orthodox champion of the Church; and a recent
event had brought home to him the danger into
which the Bohemian Reformers were running, in this
respect. Stephen Pálec̆ and Stanislaus of Znojem
had been sent as commissioners to the Council of
Pisa; on their way thither they had been arrested
at Bologna and imprisoned as heretics. This so
alarmed the king, that when the Bohemian Deputation
waited on him at Kutna Hora, he not only rejected
their proposals, but sharply rebuked Hus and
his friends for bringing discredit on the nation by
tainting them with heresy.</p>

<p>Consistency of purpose, however, was never one of
the virtues of Wenceslaus. A Bohemian nobleman
of the name of Lobkovic had considerable influence
with the king; and he was a strong champion of Hus
and his party. He pointed out to Wenceslaus that
those who proposed this reform at the University
were the supporters of the king’s policy in the
Council of Pisa. Queen Sophia, with whom Hus
had already become a favourite, no doubt used her
influence in the same direction. The king was convinced
that his interests were, for the time, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
side of the Reformers; and, in January, 1409, he
issued the desired decree which granted three votes
to the Bohemian Nation in University elections.</p>

<p>But the powerful German party did not yield without
a struggle. They pleaded that their oaths as
Masters of Arts bound them to maintain the settlement
made by Charles IV.; and they pointed out
that that Emperor had intended to make his University
the centre of all the learning of the Empire.
Finally they suggested that, if the Bohemian Nation
objected to be swamped by them, it ought to separate
from them and have a council, tribunal, and elections
of its own.</p>

<p>Of these arguments, the first may be fairly dismissed
as one of those pieces of ill-tempered rhetoric
which are usually thrust forward on such occasions.
If an oath to maintain the laws of an association
implies an opposition to any possible change in those
laws, there can be few corporations in the world
which are not deeply tainted with perjury. But the
second argument, which appealed to the wishes and
intentions of Charles IV., had undoubtedly some
plausibility, especially when one considers that the
University was only sixty years old. An answer to
this objection could, however, be easily found by the
Bohemians. Though Charles IV. had no doubt
desired to make the University the centre of the
Empire, other words of his could be quoted to show
that he had also intended that his Foundation should
secure special advantages to the Bohemians.</p>

<p>The explanation was, that Charles’s idea, however
grand, was self-contradictory; and, while inconsistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
schemes may work very well, as long as all who are
interested in them wish them to do so, they must fall
to pieces at once if they are administered by two
antagonistic parties with directly opposite ideals
about the welfare of the institution. Charles had
undoubtedly wished, as the Germans said, to make
Prague an intellectual centre for Europe; he had also
desired, as the Bohemians said, to call out the national
life and encourage the national literature of Bohemia.
It now appeared that these two objects were incompatible;
and the question was, which must yield to
the other. Charles IV. was a great statesman; but,
as in the case of so many great men, the effect which
he ultimately produced was precisely the contrary of
that which he desired. He had wished to found a
University, which should gratify the feelings both of
Bohemians and Germans, and be a centre of unity
and peace to the Empire. He had, instead, given an
impulse to life, movement, and struggle, which was to
overthrow many abuses which he condemned, but
also to drag down in their fall much which he desired
to maintain.</p>

<p>Finding that their arguments were of no avail, the
Germans devoted themselves to more practical forms
of obstruction. They insisted on disregarding the
decree of the King and on voting in the old fashion at
the next election of the Examiners. The Bohemians
resisted this attempt; and the consequence was that
no examination took place. A similar dispute arose
about the election of the Deans of Faculties; and a
similar result followed. It was obvious that the continuance
of this struggle must end in the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the work of the University. Moreover, whatever
doubts Wenceslaus might have on other subjects, he
was quite clear about the duty of enforcing his own
decrees. So, on May 9, 1409, he summoned an
extraordinary meeting of the University, at which he
appointed a new Rector and a new Dean of Arts on
his own authority. The Germans, finding further
resistance hopeless, resolved to abandon the struggle;
and, on May 16th, several thousand German students
left Prague for ever.</p>

<h2>VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE RETIREMENT OF THE GERMANS FROM
THE UNIVERSITY OF PRAGUE TO THE DEATH
OF HUS.<br />
(1409-1415.)</span></h2>

<p>The overthrow of German supremacy in the
Bohemian University has been considered by both
sides to mark a great crisis in the history of Bohemia.
The national character, which had been stamped at so
early a time on the reforming movement, now became
more visible to the world at large, and at the same time
more exclusive and defiant. Nor was its effect on the
life and death of Hus less notable. When he became
recognised as the most complete embodiment of the
principles of the Bohemian Reformation, his German
enemies naturally fixed upon him as the chief actor
in this important stage of the movement; and wild
charges of violence and intimidation towards the
Germans helped to increase the hostility which had
been roused by the suspicion of heresy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it seems clear enough that, though
Hus ultimately rejoiced in the change produced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the German secession, he had yet taken but a
secondary and hesitating part in producing the
change itself. On returning from Kuttenberg (Kutna
Hora), after Wenceslaus’s first rejection of this proposal,
Hus, disappointed and anxious, was seized with
illness; and, while worn with suffering, he asked a
friend whether, after all, the change was a just one.
This appeal has been quoted by a modern writer
as a proof of the duplicity of Hus; and the same
antagonist has scornfully contrasted this anxious
hesitation with the exulting approval of the change
which Hus proclaimed at a later time.</p>

<p>To those who try to weigh both sides of a question,
it may not seem so difficult to understand that Hus
may have heartily desired, and exulted in, the victory
of the reforming party and the freedom of the
Bohemians from German domination, and yet may
have hesitated in his own mind, especially in sickness,
about the justice of the particular step which
brought things to a crisis. The point which rather
seems to distinguish him from other men in the
matter was the candour with which he confessed
those previous doubts at a place and in a time when
such a confession was certain to be used against
him.</p>

<p>But if the charge of duplicity against Hus is
founded mainly on ignorance of human nature, the
accusation of violence which was brought against the
Bohemian reformers may have been partially due to
a confusion between two contests which were taking
place at the same time, and in which the same parties
were to some extent involved. For, while the Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and Bohemians were struggling for supremacy
in the University of Prague, Wenceslaus was devoting
his energies to the punishment of the Archbishop
and clergy for their championship of Gregory XII.
In this, as in every other case, Wenceslaus soon
damaged his cause by his utter want of self-restraint.
Mobs were let loose upon the clergy, many acts of
violence were committed, and a general sense of
insecurity prevailed. Zbynĕk, who had plenty of
that bull-dog courage which one might expect from
an ex-soldier, replied to the king’s violence by putting
Prague under an interdict. How the king might
have met this defiance one may guess from his previous
conduct; but the Archbishop and his clergy
were saved from the fate of Nepomuc by a sudden
change of circumstances.</p>

<p>The Council of Pisa had agreed to depose the two
existing claimants of the Papacy; and, after some
discussion, they chose a new Pope, under the name of
Alexander V. At first, of course, this Pope was not
very favourably inclined to an Archbishop who had
steadily opposed his election; but, when Zbynĕk
accepted his authority, and showed his appreciation
of him by sending him rich gifts, Alexander became
alarmed at the spread of heresy in Bohemia, and
granted a commission for inquiry into the writings of
Wyclif, and a permission to Zbynĕk to remove those
writings from the eyes of the faithful.</p>

<p>This commission gave a new opportunity to the
enemies of Hus; and they presented a petition against
him to the Archbishop, in which they charged him
with sixteen acts of heresy and disorder. Some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
these charges had already been put forward on former
occasions, others alleged against him heresies which
he repudiated; but there are four accusations at least
that are specially worth noting, both for their own
character, and on account of the answers made to
them by Hus. The fourth charge was that in a conversation,
which took place at the time of the drowning
of John Nepomuc and the arrest of the Dean of
Prague, Hus had spoken lightly of these acts, and
had condemned the proposal to put Prague under an
Interdict on account of them. Hus replied to this
charge by quoting his actual words. “If,” said he, “he
himself, or any other, had been killed or imprisoned,
that was no reason why men should cease to give
praise to God throughout the kingdom of Bohemia.”
The fifth clause he answered by one of those distinctions
which seemed to his enemies so dishonest. Hus
was accused of saying that anti-Christ had fixed a
foot in the Roman Church, which it was difficult
to move. To this charge Hus answered that he
had never said this of the Roman <i>Church</i>, because he
considered that that Church consisted of all those
who held the faith preached by St. Peter and St.
Paul at Rome; but that he did maintain that anti-Christ
had set his foot very firmly in the Roman
<i>Court</i> (Curia). Thirdly, he objected to two of the
charges against him on the ground that they implied
his use of words which had no equivalent in the
Bohemian language, and which, therefore, he could
not have used in the Bethlehem Chapel. Lastly, in
answer to the charge of having stirred up ill-will
between Bohemian and German, he denied that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
had done this, unless either German or Bohemian
had taken unjust occasion from his words; and he
reiterated his statement that he loved a good German
better than a bad Bohemian.</p>

<p>It was evident that these articles were intended to
identify still more closely the struggle of the Archbishop
and clergy against secular intrusion and
heretical doctrine with the struggles of the Germans
for supremacy in Bohemia. But if, by so doing,
Zbynĕk secured a stronger following in the outside
world, and bound to his cause those Germans who
had remained in Bohemia, he irritated against him
still more strongly the feeling of the Bohemian nobles
and of a large number of the citizens of Prague; and
he even alienated from him many of the inferior
clergy.</p>

<p>Another powerful influence, which was specially
exerted at this time in favour of Hus, was that of
the Queen Sophia. She had been greatly impressed
by the preacher, and had taken him as her chief
adviser, some say her confessor; and, though it may
be true of Wenceslaus that he hated Zbynĕk more
than he loved Hus, the reverse is true of his wife.
Yet in spite of all this force of opposition, Zbynĕk
showed very little sign of yielding. He consented,
indeed, to postpone any final act until the
Margrave of Moravia could be consulted. But,
whether Jodok delayed beyond the time proposed,
or whether the Archbishop simply grew tired of
waiting, he resolved, on June 10, 1410, publicly to
burn two hundred of Wyclif’s books; and accordingly
they were burnt in great state, in the court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of the archiepiscopal palace, the bells of the churches
being tolled during the performance.</p>

<p>As if to mark the man against whom this proceeding
was specially aimed, the Archbishop followed
it up by commanding the closing of all private
chapels, a command understood by everybody to be
intended especially against the chapel in which Hus
preached. Hus and his friends indignantly appealed
to the Pope against these proceedings; and they did
not fail to point out that many of the works which
were burnt were not theological at all, but simply
dealt with abstract philosophy. Indeed, the traditions
of learning and culture, which the German
scholars had hoped to secure to their side, in their
first struggle against the Bohemian language, were
now appealed to by the opposite party with much
more force. Zbynĕk was ridiculed in satirical songs
for having burnt books which he had never read;
and the University of Bologna, when consulted by
the Pope, denounced the burning of the books as an
insult to the University of Oxford. Zbynĕk, indeed,
would have fought to the last; but Pope Alexander
was shaken by the opposition which these proceedings
had called forth, and he checked the inquiry
into Wyclif’s books, and continued to delay matters,
till the decision was taken out of his hands by death.</p>

<p>Both parties made haste to approach the new Pope,
John XXIII.; and he demanded that Hus should
come to Rome. The danger of the way made a good
excuse for refusal; and John, having received rich
presents from Zbynĕk, consented to excommunicate
Hus for contumacy. This, however, did not affect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Wenceslaus’s attitude; for, irritated by Zbynĕk’s
opposition, and impressed by the queen’s partiality
for Hus, the king had become a zealous champion
of the Reformers. He demanded that Zbynĕk
should compensate those whose books he had
burnt; and, on his refusal, he confiscated his property
for the benefit of the owners of the books.
At the same time the king and his friends wrote to
the Pope to assure him that he had been ill-informed
about the circumstances of the case. The Pope
being thus politely set on one side, and riot and
disorder continuing, there seemed an opportunity for
some outsider to step in.</p>

<p>This opportunity was eagerly seized by Sigismund.
He had never formally resigned that administrative
power which Wenceslaus had granted to him in his
time of emergency; and, though he had nominally
supported Wenceslaus against Rupert in his claim
to the Imperial crown, he was now intriguing to succeed
the latter and to set aside his brother. Wenceslaus,
on his part, was willing enough to listen to
proposals for peace when they did not come from
a clerical source; and Zbynĕk consented to accept
the arbitration proposed. But, when the arbitrators
demanded that the archbishop should write to the
Pope to ask him to repeal the excommunication of
Hus, Zbynĕk refused to submit to this decision; and
he went to Presburg to appeal personally to Sigismund.
There, however, he fell ill and died; and,
in a few months, the controversy had assumed quite
another form.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Council of Pisa had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
professed to put an end to the disunion in the Church
by deposing the two claimants of the Papacy, and
electing Alexander V. in their place. But, though
Alexander V., and his successor, John XXIII., had
probably been accepted by a majority of the authorities
of the Church, the deposed Popes still, at times,
put forward claims which could easily be taken advantage
of by those who wished to stir up division
in the Church. Ladislaus, the king of Naples, who
had a grudge against John, took up the cause of
Gregory XII. Therefore, in December, 1411, John
proclaimed a crusade against the King of Naples,
and promised plenary indulgence to all who would
support this expedition, either in purse or person.</p>

<p>The commissioners for promoting this war arrived
in Prague in 1412; and they soon set to work, not
merely to preach the crusade, but to organise a
regular system for the sale of the indulgences. Some
attempt to start this trade had been begun in 1393,
but it does not seem to have been then carried on
on so extensive a scale. <i>Now</i> the Legate farmed
out the right of selling these indulgences to other
priests, granting them preferment in the Church, and
receiving from them a commission on what they
raised. As respectable clergymen would not often
undertake such an office, the trade fell into the
hands of men of disreputable lives, who were thus
brought prominently to the front. Hus had objected,
from the first, to the attempt to involve the Bohemians
in a war which he considered unchristian;
and, when to the proposal for the crusade was added
the organisation of the sale of indulgences, he determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to raise the question in an assembly of the
University.</p>

<p>But he now found that some, who had been hitherto
his followers, were prepared to resist and oppose him.
Stanislaus of Znojem and Stephen Pálec̆ had been
released from their imprisonment at Bologna, at the
request of Wenceslaus; and since their return to
Prague they had gradually drifted into the ranks
of the opponents of reform. Stanislaus had been
the first to show this change. The charge of heresy
on which he had been arrested had been based on
a pamphlet dealing with Wyclif’s doctrines. He
pleaded that the apparent Wyclifite tendency of the
pamphlet was due to its incompleteness; and, when
ordered to finish it, he did so in a sense hostile to
the doctrines of Wyclif.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, though Hus had repudiated
many of the doctrines of the English Reformer,
he had yet opposed the general condemnation of his
works, and had spoken warmly of his character.
Therefore Stanislaus’ attack upon Wyclif paved the
way for an open opposition to Hus. Pálec̆, indeed,
had remained on the side of his old leader during
the struggle with Zbynĕk, but the opposition to the
Papal Bull drove him also into the orthodox ranks.
The cry of cowardice has been raised against him
by the friends of Hus, and seems, indeed, to have
been sanctioned by Hus himself. But, unscrupulous
and malignant as Pálec̆ afterwards showed himself,
it may be doubted whether the charge of cowardice
was, in this instance, a just one. It must be remembered
that in his previous opposition to Popes, Hus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
had protected himself by the well-recognised formula
that the Pope had been misinformed on the condition
of affairs in Bohemia. On this occasion the
question at issue was not so much one of information
about special facts as of clear moral principles;
and the issue of the Bull took away all possibility
of throwing the blame of the Pope’s action on misleading
advisers. Moreover, the opposition of Hus
was no longer covered by the authority of the King.
Wenceslaus, having once committed himself to opposition
to Gregory, was not disposed to inquire too
curiously into the methods which were used to suppress
the fallen Pope. He had therefore sanctioned
John’s Bull, and thereby approved the crusade. It
may well, therefore, have been that Pálec̆, though
willing to resist the ordinary current of clerical
opinion, might yet doubt the lawfulness and propriety
of setting himself against his spiritual and
temporal rulers. At any rate, when Hus brought
before the Masters of the University his proposal to
denounce the crusade and its methods, Pálec̆ and
Stanislaus headed the opposition to their former
leader, and won the majority of the Masters to their
side.</p>

<p>But Hus was not to be silenced. He continued
to preach and write against the sale of indulgences;
and he proposed to hold a discussion on the Papal
Bull in the Carolinum, a college founded for the
clergy by Charles IV. He was now compelled
into a position which seems to anticipate the more
advanced Reformers of the following century; for
when the new Archbishop, Albik, called on him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
obey the Apostolic commands, he answered that the
Apostolic commands were those contained in the
teaching of Christ and His Apostles; that, so far as
the Pope’s commands agreed with them, he would
obey them gladly; but that, if they did not agree
with them, he would not obey them, if the fire were
kindled in his presence.</p>

<p>Hus was now at issue with old friends, with the
leaders of learning, and with the rulers of Church and
State. It was therefore with special satisfaction that
he must have hailed a new supporter who came to
his aid at this crisis. This was a young Bohemian
nobleman, named Hieronymus, or Jerom. He has
often been credited with the first introduction of
Wyclif’s works into Bohemia, though some historians
have thrown doubt on this claim. Whether it were
so or not, he certainly now formed a link between
the reforming leaders and the fashionable world,
which did not previously exist. His easy circumstances
and noble birth gave him entrance to the
Court circles of Europe; and his attractive manners,
splendid dress, and love of display gained him fame
and popularity. Moreover, he had found great
delight in exciting discussions on doubtful points
of theology in the various Universities which he
had visited. He began these discussions at Heidelberg,
apparently against the wish of the University
authorities. He had visited Oxford, whither a
reputation for heresy had preceded him; and he
had specially provoked the opposition of Gerson,
the Chancellor of the Paris University, by the controversies
which he had inaugurated in that famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
centre of learning. He now plunged boldly into
the dispute about the sale of indulgences. His
brilliant and polished oratory threw into shade for
the time the simpler eloquence of Hus. He was
followed home, on one occasion, by a large crowd of
students; and the reforming movement began to
attract the sympathies of the younger nobles.</p>

<p>But it soon became evident that the new converts
would bring more zeal than dignity to the camp of the
reformers. The forms of ridicule of the clerical party
indulged in by these fiery spirits can scarcely have
been welcome to the soberer reformers who had been
first drawn to the teaching of Hus. Thus, for instance,
a procession was organised, which marched
through the streets of Prague, and in which the chief
figure was a student, who was dressed as a woman
of ill-fame, wearing round her neck an imitation of
the Papal Bulls. Such demonstrations as these,
when accompanied by satirical songs, naturally led
to disorder and riot. Wenceslaus, who was divided
in feeling between his friendliness to Hus and his
desire to enforce his own decrees, tried in vain to
effect a compromise between the contending parties,
and, finding reconciliation or even partial restraint
impossible, he forbad the reformers to offer any
further opposition to the sale of indulgences.</p>

<p>This decree at once called out the sterner and
nobler side of the reforming spirit. In spite of the
king’s prohibition, three young men came to the
church where the champions of the indulgences were
preaching, and made a public protest against the
preacher’s words. The intruders were promptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
secured by the officials of the town council, and were
at once taken to the Great Ring. A large crowd
gathered to see what was intended, and Hus came
forward to remind the councillors that he was the
first promoter of the opposition to the indulgences,
and that they ought therefore to punish him before
they punished these young men. The Councillors
gave an answer which seemed to imply that the
prisoners should not be injured; but no sooner had
the crowd dispersed than the youths were taken into
a side street and summarily executed.</p>

<p>Great excitement followed this treachery; and
numbers of people paraded the streets declaring
their readiness to die for the truth. Hus, from his
pulpit, praised the young men who had been executed,
and exhorted his hearers to stand by the truth.</p>

<p>Another opponent now came forward to give new
impulse to the attacks on Hus. This was a German
priest of questionable antecedents, called Michael de
Causis. He drew up a list of articles against the
reformer, which revived, more definitely, the charge
of sympathising with Wyclif’s doctrine, both as to
the Sacraments, and the interference of secular
authorities with the property of the clergy. With
these charges Michael now combined the accusation
of stirring up the people against the bishops, and
making ill-feeling in the University. Pope John,
already indignant at the opposition to his Bull, was
roused by these charges to more decided action. He
excommunicated Hus, and laid an Interdict on
Prague. Several Germans tried to give practical
force to this sentence by rushing armed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Bethlehem chapel, and attempting to kill Hus; but
his friends rallied round him, and the assassins were
forced to retire.</p>

OPPONENTS OF THE INDULGENCE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>During all this time Wenceslaus seems to have
shown towards Hus a forbearance such as he hardly
ever exhibited towards others who crossed his path.
Doubtless one must trace in this conduct the influence
of the queen; but, to whatever cause it was due, it
did not fail to affect the feelings of Hus. He was
shocked at the amount of disorder and bitterness
prevailing in Prague; and he was grieved to think
that he was, to some extent, the cause of it. The
desire for peace and concession which these considerations
produced was naturally quickened by
personal gratitude to the King; and he now consented
to leave Prague for a time, and to retire to Austi,
where he remained under the protection of a powerful
noble.</p>

<p>It was during this retirement that he composed
the book “De Ecclesia,” which was to cost him so
dear. In this he declared, more distinctly than
before, his disbelief in the necessity of the Pope and
Cardinals as a part of the constitution of the Church,
and his belief in the essential equality of all Orders
of the clergy. But his retirement from Prague
brought no cessation to the fierceness of the controversy.
Jakaubek of Kladrau, who now took the lead
among the friends of Hus, demanded a reformation
of the lives of the clergy, and declared that no peace
could be made till these were amended. Wenceslaus
once more stepped in as peacemaker. He appointed
a commission of four, to which the representatives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the opposite parties were to present their different
statements for consideration and arbitration. Stanislaus
and his friends drew up an address, in which they
spoke of the Church, “whose head is the Pope, and
whose body is the Cardinals.” For this Jakaubek and
his friends proposed to substitute the words, “whose
head is Jesus Christ our Saviour, and His representative
is the Pope.” When, however, the opposite
parties came before the arbitrators, Stanislaus, Pálec̆,
and their friends refused to submit to the order of
discussion suggested by the commissioners; whereupon
Wenceslaus cut short the proceedings by
banishing from Bohemia Stanislaus, Pálec̆, and two of
their friends, as disturbers of the peace.</p>

<p>In the meantime Hus had been vexed with scruples
of conscience, as to whether he had violated his duty
in consenting to leave Prague, and to abandon his
pulpit at the order of the King; and, after vainly
endeavouring to satisfy himself by a comparison
of quotations from St. Augustine and others, he at
last came back to Prague, though he could not at
once make up his mind so far to defy the king as to
return to his pulpit in the Bethlehem Chapel. While
he was in this hesitating state, the crisis arrived
which was to solve his difficulties for him, and give
him the longed-for opportunity of vindicating his
teaching before the world, without directly defying
the King of Bohemia.</p>

<p>In August, 1414, Sigismund once more arrived in
Prague. He had contrived, on the death of Count
Rupert, to get himself elected Holy Roman Emperor,
but had afterwards reconciled Wenceslaus to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
arrangement, by promising to recognise the latter
as Emperor, during his life, if Wenceslaus would
allow him to retain the name of King of the Romans,
which implied heirship to the Empire. This promise
seems to have been very ill-kept; but probably
Wenceslaus was too busy with his Bohemian troubles
to care to enforce a claim which had formerly proved
so irksome to him. At the period at which we have
arrived, he was contented to leave both the dignity
and power to his brother.</p>

<p>Circumstances now afforded a splendid opening
for the display of both. The quarrel between John
and Ladislaus, after being patched up by a temporary
peace, had broken out again so fiercely that John had
been forced to fly from Rome, and to take refuge in
Bologna. From thence he appealed to Sigismund to
call a new Council for the settlement of the troubles
of the Church, and the final suppression of the schism
in the papacy; and he consented that it should be
held in the free, Imperial town of Constance. Hus
also saw his opportunity in this Council, and he
appealed to Sigismund to secure him a public
hearing before it. Sigismund readily consented, and
promised also to give a safe-conduct for the purpose.
Before starting, however, Hus secured from the new
Archbishop, Conrad, and from the chief Inquisitor in
Bohemia, letters declaring their belief in his orthodoxy.
He then put himself under the special care of John
of Chlum and Wenceslaus of Duba, and, under their
escort, he started from Prague, without waiting for
the arrival of the safe-conduct. To judge by some
expressions in his letter to Sigismund, and still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
by a letter which he left at Prague, to be opened by
a friend in case of his death, Hus had already a
gloomy anticipation of the fate which awaited him.
But his spirits rose as the journey continued; for
everywhere he met with kindness and hospitality,
even from the Germans, and at Nürnberg he was
chosen to preach before the nobles and clergy. So,
with raised hopes, on the 3rd of November, 1414, he
arrived at the town of Constance.</p>

<p>He and his friends were somewhat startled to find
that the inn at which he lodged was close to that
already occupied by the Pope, who had so recently
excommunicated him. John of Chlum and Henry
of Lac̆embok decided that the best course would be
to go at once to the Pope, and tell him that Hus had
arrived, under the promise of safe-conduct from the
Emperor. The Pope answered that he had no desire
to hinder Hus in any way; that he had no wish to do
him any violence; and that Hus might remain safe
in Constance, even if he had killed the Pope’s own
brother. The arrival, two days later, of a messenger
from Sigismund bearing the safe-conduct must have
further confirmed Hus’s sense of security; and, so
safe did his friends suppose him, that a rumour even
spread among some of them that he was to preach
before the Council.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, there had arrived in Constance
two enemies far more deadly to Hus than Pope
or King. These were Michael de Causis, the German
priest, and Stephen Pálec̆, his former friend and
recent opponent, who had so lately been banished
from Prague as a disturber of the peace. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
agreed to draw up extracts, chiefly compiled from
Hus’s book “De Ecclesia,” some of them tolerably
accurate, others perverting his meaning. These Pálec̆
carried about among the Cardinals, bishops, and friars,
and he stirred them up to take action against Hus.
At last, on the 28th of November, while Hus was at
dinner, there arrived at his house two bishops, the
burgomaster of Constance, and a German gentleman.
Not knowing Hus by sight, they first applied to John
of Chlum for an opportunity of speaking with Hus,
on behalf of the Cardinals. Chlum seems at once to
have suspected treachery, and he told them that Hus
had come to Constance to speak publicly before
the Emperor and Council, and that he was under
the protection of the Emperor’s safe-conduct. The
bishops answered that they had come in the interests
of peace and to prevent disorder. Then Hus, rising
from table, came to them, and said that, though he
had come to speak to the whole Council and not to
the Cardinals only, yet, if the Cardinals desired it, he
would come to see them.</p>

<p>When he was brought to the palace, the Cardinals
told him that they had been informed that he taught
many errors. He answered that he would sooner die
than teach errors, and he would amend any if they
were shown to him. Then the Cardinals went away
for a time, leaving him under the guard of soldiers.
Still, they seem to have hesitated, and, in order to
obtain clearer proof, they sent a monk to try to entrap
him into confession of heresy. But, when this failed,
Stephen Pálec̆ and Michael de Causis urged them to
arrest him. One point, which they strongly pressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
in proof of his heresy, was the practice which Jakaubek
of Kladrau had introduced since the departure of
Hus, of administration of the Communion in both
kinds to the laity. Then they raised against him the
charge which he had so often denied, of a sympathy
with Wyclif’s opposition to the doctrine of Transubstantiation.
They revived the old grievances of the
Germans in the matter of the University votes, and
then charged him with having incited to the plunder
of the clergy, and of having stood alone in the
support of the doctrines of Wyclif against both
Germans and Bohemians. The Cardinals then sent
a messenger to Chlum, who had accompanied Hus
to the palace, and told him that he might leave Hus
and return home. Chlum hastened to the Pope,
reminded him of his former promise, and insisted
again on Sigismund’s safe-conduct. Pope John
answered that he had not ordered the arrest of Hus,
but that he could not resist the Cardinals.</p>

<p>Hus, in the meantime, had been hurried off to a
Dominican convent, in a suburb of Constance, and
was there thrown into a damp prison. Chlum was not,
however, to be silenced; and he put up bills on the
great church at Constance, denouncing the Pope and
Cardinals for their breach of faith. Then he appealed
to the Bohemian nobles who had come to the
Council; and they and the leading Polish nobles
also prepared a protest against the treatment of Hus,
to be presented to Sigismund on his arrival. In the
meantime, the treatment of Hus showed a mixture
of cruelty and cunning on the part of his opponents.
While, on the one hand, the prison in which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
confined was so damp as to produce fever, he was
yet allowed to communicate freely with his friends;
and two of the letters which he wrote from prison
had some influence on his fate. In one of these he
defended the practice, which Jakaubek was now introducing,
of Communion in both kinds. In the
other he declared that, even if he were condemned
by false witnesses, his friends were not to believe that
he had forsaken the truth. This latter letter seems
to have fallen into the hands of Pálec̆, or some
other enemy; and it was at once perverted into
the statement that, if he revoked and recanted anything
at Constance, he would still continue to hold
and teach it notwithstanding.</p>

<p>While these intrigues of the enemies of Hus were
being reduced into a literary form, Sigismund at last
arrived at Constance. Most English readers will
remember the scene, as Carlyle has given it, of his
splendid appearance on his entrance into the Council,
of his pompous address about the need of suppressing
the schism in the Church, and of his rebuke to the
man who ventured to correct his Latin&mdash;“Rex sum
Romanus et super grammaticam.”</p>

<p>The question of Hus’s imprisonment was brought
before him by the Bohemian and Polish nobles; and
he at first protested, with much indignation, against
the violation of his safe-conduct. But the necessity
of dealing with the question of the Papacy compelled
him, for a time, to abandon further inquiry into the
Bohemian heresies; for the representatives of the
Popes arrived soon after at the Council. At first the
discussion was confined to the consideration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
disorders produced by the multiplication of claimants
to the Papal throne; and a demand was made for the
simultaneous resignation of all the rivals, in order
that the ground might be cleared for a new election.
But it soon became evident that the case against
John XXIII. was based on very different grounds from
the opposition to his rivals; and fearing the consequences
which might ensue, he fled from Constance.
The Duke of Austria, willing enough to hamper a
Council presided over by a member of the House of
Luxemburg, lent his aid to this scheme, and John
escaped to Freyburg. He was, however, seized and
brought back; and he was soon after degraded from
the Papacy, on account of his horrible crimes.</p>

<p>His attempted escape gave a new opportunity to
the enemies of Hus. If, they said, one prisoner of
the Council could escape, why not another? Hus
was too lightly guarded at the convent; and he must
be put under safer charge. Therefore, on the night
of March 24th, a guard of a hundred and seventy
armed men carried him off to a fortress, outside
the city, belonging to the Bishop of Constance; and
there he was chained night and day. Again his
friends indignantly protested; but Sigismund was
now evidently falling under hostile influences. He
had been offended already with Hus for having come
to the Council without waiting for the safe-conduct;
and he was persuaded that the fact that Hus possessed
that safe-conduct had been in some way suppressed.
Indignant at this rumour, Sigismund, on the 8th of
April, by the advice of the Council, revoked all the
letters of safe-conduct which he had granted. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
last, on April 17th, commissioners were appointed to
report on Hus’s case.</p>

<p>It appears to have been about this time that
Jerom also arrived at the Council. His career, since
the struggle against the indulgences had been very
unsatisfactory. He had first gone to Presburg to
preach before Sigismund, and had there been imprisoned.
Escaping from prison, he had made his
way to Vienna; but had again been arrested there,
and had consented to submit to an examination by
an Austrian bishop. Set free on parole, he had
broken his word and fled back to Bohemia, from
whence he addressed a taunting letter to the bishop.
It was, therefore, under the shadow of some discredit
that he came to Constance, and offered to answer
any charges of heresy which might be brought
against him. At the same time he demanded a safe-conduct
from Sigismund; and, not being able to
obtain it, he fled from Constance, to which he was
forcibly brought back by the officers of the Duke of
Bavaria. He was then imprisoned, and kept heavily
ironed for nearly a year.</p>

<p>Hus accused him of having disregarded the advice
of his friends; and though it is not clear, whether
this refers to his coming to the Council, or to his
conduct when there, it is certain that his appearance
must have made Hus’s position more difficult.</p>

<p>At last, on May 14, 1415, the nobles of Bohemia
and Poland were able to make their protest before
the Council against the treatment of Hus. They
also indignantly complained of the insults and
slanders which were being circulated against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Bohemian nation, as if they were profaners of the
Sacrament, and guilty of all sorts of indecencies in
its celebration. The Bishop of Litomys̆l rose in
answer to this to say that he was the author of these
reports; and that this desecration of the Sacrament
was the natural consequence of granting the cup to
the laity. Another bishop answered their reference
to Hus’s safe-conduct by saying that Hus only
obtained it after his imprisonment. To this the
Bohemian lords retorted that John of Chlum had
himself shown the safe-conduct to the Pope before
the arrest of Hus. They defended his non-appearance
at Rome in answer to the summons of the Pope;
and they produced the testimony of the University
of Prague to his orthodoxy. Then, after reiterating
their denial of the charges made by the Bishop of
Litomys̆l, they wound up with a rather amusing
outburst of aristocratic feeling. The Bishop of
Litomys̆l had demanded their names, that he might
know to whom he had to give answer. They had
fancied that their names were tolerably well known
to him; but, for their part, they were perfectly
willing to give not only their own names, but those
of their ancestors. On a later occasion they produced
the certificate which the Bohemian Inquisitor
had given to Hus.</p>

<p>At last, after repeated appeals, Hus was granted
an audience on June 5th. But no sooner did he
try to answer the various charges brought against
him, then all the Council howled at him, and, after
demanding that he should give a simple answer
(Yes! or No!), were proceeding to condemn him on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the evidence of the falsified letter to his friends.
Fortunately Oldr̆ich and Peter Mladenovich, who had
accompanied Hus to Constance, heard the noise of
the riot, and hastened to inform John of Chlum and
Wenceslaus of Duba. They went at once to Sigismund,
who was not present at the Council; and he
sent the Count Palatine and Frederick of Hohenzollern
to order the Councillors to hear Hus patiently.
After some further disorder, the audience was adjourned
to the 7th of June.</p>

<p>At the next meeting many new points were raised
against Hus, both of doctrine and conduct. He
defended his resistance to the condemnation of
Wyclif’s books, on the ground that he had been
called on to say that every proposition of Wyclif’s
was either heretical, scandalous, or erroneous. At
the same time he admitted that he had wished his
soul to be with Wyclif, on account of Wyclif’s pure
life. When charged with having appealed to Christ
when condemned by the Pope, he declared that to
be a most just and efficacious appeal, a statement
which was received with laughter by his judges. At
the same time he indignantly denied having encouraged
his followers to smite with the material
sword. Lastly, while maintaining the justice of the
decision about the Bohemian votes, he denied the
extraordinary charge of Pálec̆ that he had driven out
the Germans.</p>

<p>But he was, unfortunately, doomed to irritate
against him on every occasion the intense vanity of
Sigismund. One great object of his enemies was to
deprive him of any benefit accruing to him from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
his safe-conduct; and they caught eagerly at an
expression of his that he had come, freely and voluntarily,
to the Council. Provoked at the constant
distortions of his language, he broke out with a boast,
which, however true, was most ill-judged. If, he said,
he had not wished to come to the Council, neither
King nor Emperor could have compelled him; for
there were many friends who would have hidden him
in their houses, so that neither Wenceslaus nor Sigismund
could have found him. When a murmur arose
at this, John of Chlum stepped forward and said that,
though he was but a poor gentlemen in his own
country, he, for one, would have guarded Hus for a
year, whoever liked or disliked it; and that there
were many others who would have protected him in
strong castles. This belittling of his power roused
Sigismund’s anger. He exclaimed that he had sent
Hus his safe-conduct before he left Prague; and that
he had provided the noblemen for his escort; and he
now advised Hus to submit himself completely to
the Council. Hus at once answered, in his more
ordinary tone, that he thanked Sigismund for the
safe-conduct; and, for his part, he would be glad to
be corrected by the Council if he were shown to be
wrong.</p>

<p>On June 8th, he was examined more in detail on
thirty-nine Articles gathered from his writings. Some
of these dealt with the subtle questions of Predestination;
but others were concerned with his assertions
in the “De Ecclesia” that a visible head was not
necessary to the Church; and that a Pope in mortal
sin ceases to be a true Pope. Hus was able, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
great force, to appeal to the action of the Council
itself in justification of these doctrines. If a Pope in
mortal sin did not cease to be a true Pope, by what
right had they deposed John XXIII.? If the visible
Head was necessary to the Church, who was the
Head <i>then</i>, when all the Popes had either resigned or
been deposed? Such arguments were probably too
forcible to be convincing.</p>

<p>But again, by some strange fatality, Hus was
further to irritate against him the suspicion and
anger of the Holy Roman Emperor. “Not only,”
said Hus, “did a Pope cease to be a true Pope if in
mortal sin, but the case of the deposition of Saul by
Samuel showed that a King might be treated in a
similar way.” Sigismund was sitting at a window
in a back part of the room when this utterance was
made; but the Cardinals eagerly called him forward
and made Hus repeat his statement. Nor was this
the only offence which he was doomed to commit
against the Emperor on that fatal day. When the
examination had concluded, the chief Cardinal asked
Hus whether he would submit entirely to the Council,
or if he wished to defend any of the Articles alleged
against him. But when Hus demanded an opportunity
for further discussion, the Cardinal answered
that the Council insisted on his abjuration and revocation
of the Articles alleged against him, and his
promise not to preach them any more. To this Hus
answered, that he could not revoke and abjure
opinions which he had never held, mentioning as an
instance the denial of Transubstantiation. As for the
opinions which he had set forth, he would retract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
them when they had been refuted. Sigismund endeavoured
to convince him that he could abjure
Articles which he had never held; whereupon Hus
ventured to dispute the Emperor’s use of the word
“abjurare.” This further denial of the power of the
Roman Emperor over the Latin language roused to
a still higher pitch the irritation of Sigismund “Super
Grammaticam;” and he told Hus that, unless he would
abjure and revoke all the errors alleged against him,
the Council must deal with him according to its laws.</p>

<p>Upon this a fat and richly dressed priest, who was
sitting in the window, cried out that they should not
allow him to recant, since he would not keep his word;
and again he quoted the falsified version of Hus’s
letter. Then Pálec̆ and Michael de Causis pressed
upon him a number of charges, some new and some
old, mixing up actual writings and doings of Hus
with doctrines which he had repudiated; and, after
this had continued for some time, the Council decided
to send him back to prison, to see if a period of delay
would induce him to revoke his heresies.</p>

<p>For the moment Hus seemed to be crushed by the
noise and bitterness of his enemies. He was leaving
the Council with the sense that the world was entirely
against him, when, as he drew near to the door, John
of Chlum pressed through the crowd and shook him
warmly by the hand. The memory of that handshake
seems to have lingered to the last in the mind
of Hus. Other friends, too, were still faithful to him;
and, after he had left the Council, several of them
pressed to the window of the convent where the
Council was being held, to hear what should follow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Sigismund was now thoroughly inflamed against
Hus. He had belittled the protection which Sigismund
had offered him, and had declared that his friends could
protect him against the Emperor; he had quoted a
Scriptural instance of the deposition of kings; and,
above all, he had disputed Sigismund’s authority over
the Latin language. Such a man could not be
suffered to live; and the Emperor now declared that
he delivered him over to the Council to be burnt, if
they so pleased; adding further, that no recantation
was to be trusted. He also implied that the death of
Jerom must follow that of Hus.</p>

<p>Hus now saw that his fate was sealed; and one
observes in his letters to his friends the tone of a man
who is preparing for death. He was particularly
anxious, lest the more ignorant of his followers should
suffer for doctrines which they had not understood,
and which they had merely adopted from
a sense of personal devotion to their teacher. So
he wrote to one of these followers, that, if he should
be attacked for his adherence to Hus, he should
answer his accusers by saying, “I hope that the Master
was a good Christian, but I have not understood or
read through the things which he taught in the
schools.” The thought of the corruptions of the
clergy still weighed upon his mind; and he advised
his nephews rather to learn some manual work than
to become priests; lest, if they assumed the spiritual
office, they should not maintain it as it deserved.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Council, with singular maladroitness,
had singled out for special condemnation
the granting of the Cup to the laity; and thus, at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
stroke, they changed the doctrine of a few obscure
men into the war-cry of an indignant nation. This
decree called the attention to Hus to this matter,
which, till then, he had not deeply considered; and
he wrote to his successor at the Bethlehem Chapel
that he ought not to oppose the granting of the Cup
to the laity, since there was nothing but custom against
it; and that, if he opposed Jakaubek, there would be
a division amongst the faithful.</p>

<p>But, while Hus was thus interesting himself in the
affairs of his countrymen, the Council were not suffering
him to rest in peace. One of the few priests who
had shown themselves friendly to Hus at the Council
wrote to him urging sophistical arguments in favour
of a form of recantation; and Pálec̆ paid him several
visits, to worry him into confessions of heresy. Yet,
bitterly as he felt the persecutions of his former
follower, that same self-distrust and earnest desire
for justice which he had shown in the question of the
three votes, and again on his retirement from Prague,
appeared, even more remarkably, in this last interview.
He entreated his enemy to pardon him for having
charged him with deliberate falsehood on the occasion
of Pálec̆’s first attacks in the Council. The savage
apostate was moved even to tears for the moment,
though his pity was of short duration.</p>

<p>At last, on July 5th, Wenceslaus of Duba and John
of Chlum were sent to the prison to demand Hus’s
final answer. But these messengers had been ill-chosen
as exponents of the sophistries of Sigismund
and the Cardinals. John of Chlum addressed the
prisoner as follows: “Master John, we are laymen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
cannot advise you. Therefore, see if there is anything
in the things which they object to you, in which you
feel you are to blame. If so, do not fear to be instructed
and to revoke it; but, if you do not feel
yourself guilty in your conscience in these things,
then by no means act against your conscience, nor
lie in the sight of God, but rather continue till the
death in the truth which you have acknowledged.”
Then Hus answered, “Lord John! know, that if I
knew that I had written or preached anything contrary
to the law or to our Holy Mother the Church,
God is my witness that I would humbly revoke it.
But I always desired that they should show me better
and more probable Scriptures than those that I had
taught; and, if they are shown me, I will most readily
recant.” A bishop, who had come with the Bohemian
nobles, now introduced the sophistical platitude which
is common on such occasions&mdash;“Do you wish,” he
said, “to be wiser than the whole Council?” “I do
not wish,” answered Hus, “to be wiser than the whole
Council; but I ask you to give me the least of the
Council who can inform me by better and more
efficacious Scriptures; and I am ready to revoke
what I said.”</p>

<p>On the following day he was brought forth to
receive his final condemnation. The articles on
which he was to be condemned were read out against
him, though he continued to protest against the
manner in which his words had been perverted. To
his horror, he found that they had added to the
charges against him a new article, in which he was
accused of saying that he was a fourth person of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Deity. He demanded the name of the author of this
slander; but the Council refused to tell him. Then,
as a climax to his offences, they quoted his appeal to
Christ as against the Pope. At that he cried out “O
Lord God! do this Council condemn Thy law and
Thy acts as an error? because Thou, when oppressed
by Thy enemies, didst commit Thy cause to Thy God
and Father, and gavest us thereby an example to
appeal to Thee as the justest Judge, humbly demanding
Thy help.” Then for the last time he recapitulated
the circumstances under which he had come to
the Council. When he referred to the safe-conduct,
he fixed his eye upon Sigismund; and the Emperor
was observed to blush. This blush is worth mentioning
as the only sign of grace in that mean and
treacherous career. But, of course, neither appeal
nor blush could avail Hus anything; and his statement
was almost immediately followed by his condemnation
to the stake.</p>

<p>Then he knelt down and said, “Lord Jesus Christ,
pardon all my enemies for Thy great mercy; Thou
knowest that they have falsely accused me, that they
have produced false witnesses, and that they have
produced false articles against me; pardon them for
Thy mercy.” This prayer was received with shouts
of laughter. Then they stripped him of his priestly
dress, and put on him a crown which declared him to
be an Heresiarch. This was followed by a proclamation
committing his soul to the devil, to which he
answered, “And I commit it to my blessed Lord
Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>He had now quite recovered his composure; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
on his way to the stake, he smiled when he saw the
place where his books were being burnt; and he
smiled again when the paper crown fell off his head
and he saw the three demons which had been painted
on it. When they put a heavy chain round his neck
to fasten him to the stake, he exclaimed, “The Lord
Jesus my Redeemer was bound with a heavier chain
for me.” Even after the faggots had been piled round
him, the officials came to him, asking him to recant.
He answered by repudiating the false charges that
had been made against him, and declared that he
had only preached the truth of the gospel and the
holy Doctors. Then, as they lit the fire round him,
he cried out, “Christ, Son of the living God, have
mercy on me;” but, as he added the words, “Who
wast born of the Virgin Mary,” a flame struck him
on the mouth, and he died praying.</p>

<p class="smaller">N.B.&mdash;For the two stories which are most generally quoted about
Hus, I can find no sufficient authority. The beautiful tradition of
his comment on the woman who brought the faggot to burn him,
seems to belong to a much later date; while the earliest authority,
which I have discovered, for the prophecy about the goose and the
swan, is Martin Luther himself. But both the stories are eminently
characteristic; and they deserve to live as legend, if not as authentic
history.</p>

<h2>IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE DEATH OF HUS TO THE FIRST CORONATION
OF SIGISMUND.<br />
(July 6, 1415-July 28, 1420.)</span></h2>

<p>Few great teachers are ever well represented by
their immediate followers and disciples; but hardly
any have been distinguished from their followers by
so many and such important differences as those
which separated John Hus from the men who are
known by his name. First of all there was the gulf
which separates the man who rejoices to die for his
faith from those who delight in killing on its behalf.
But that difference between teacher and follower,
though much more vital, is, perhaps, also more common
than the barrier of doctrinal difference which
separated Hus from those who claimed to represent
him. The very practice, which supplied the war-cry
of the coming struggle, was one which Hus had
merely approved with a friendly tolerance, never
advocated with any special enthusiasm; and that
difference of feeling is characteristic of the whole
relations between Hus and his followers. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
one hand the constitutional reforms of the Church,
hinted at in the “De Ecclesia,” would certainly have
been rejected by the Calixtine party; while, on the
other hand, the doctrines and practices of the Taborites
would have been opposed by Hus himself. It
will therefore be more convenient, in describing the
following struggle, to speak of the Reformers by their
doctrinal name of “Utraquists,” rather than by the
personal but misleading title of “Hussite.”</p>

<p>But, if the spirit of the living Hus could scarcely
be said to rest upon those who called themselves by
his name, undoubtedly the death of Hus was recognised,
on both sides, as the essential cause of the wars
which followed. Men might wrangle about this or
that doctrine or practice; but the murder of a Bohemian,
in a place to which he had been sent under the
special protection of the King and the nobles, was a
point which could never be forgiven or forgotten
against Sigismund or the Council of Constance;
especially when this murder was connected with an
attempt to brand as heretics the whole Bohemian
nation. This feeling breathes through the fiery
letter of the nobles of Bohemia, which was sent to
the Council on the 2nd of September, 1415. They
accused the Councillors of having condemned Hus
on false evidence; and they declared him to be a
good Catholic. They give the lie to all to dare to
assert that there is heresy in Bohemia or Moravia,
except only to the Emperor Sigismund, who, they
<i>hope</i>, is innocent in the matter; and they declare
that they will defend the law of Christ and His
preachers, even to the shedding of blood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>While the nobles threw down their gauntlet to the
Council in this formal manner, the main body of the
people showed their feeling by fierce riots against the
monks. Churches and monasteries were burnt; many
monks were driven from Prague, and some priests
were killed in the riots. The Archbishop of Prague
determined to stand by his Order; and he too fixed
on the Communion in both kinds as the dividing line
between the two parties. Finding that he could
neither prohibit this practice nor obtain compensation
for the injuries done to the clergy, he laid Prague
under an Interdict.</p>

<p>This Interdict became a new source of division.
The Utraquists utterly disregarded it, and exposed
themselves to the charge of rebellion against the
Church. The Catholics, on the other hand, scrupulously
recognised the archbishop’s decree, and therefore
felt bound to celebrate their services only in
the Vys̆ehrad, which was outside the prohibited
area. The Catholic visits to that fortress were compared
by the Utraquists to the more celebrated
pilgrimages to Mecca; and hence the name of
Mahometan was added to the other terms of abuse,
which were being so freely scattered by the rival
theologians.</p>

<p>The attitude of Wenceslaus was wavering and
uncertain. He had, indeed, been disposed to accept
the Council’s condemnation of the granting of the
Cup to the laity; but he had used his best influence
to save Hus, and he had resented his execution,
as another proof of that faithlessness of
Sigismund, of which he had already had such painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
experience. He refused, however, to join the League
which the nobles had formed to defend the liberties
of Bohemia, partly, perhaps, because they connected
it with a defence of the practice just condemned by
the Council; and he even consented to support an
Opposition League formed by the Catholic nobles
in defence of the Church.</p>

<p>Sigismund, on his part, began to entertain hopes
that he might contrive to sow division between these
rival parties; and, feeling that his share in the death
of Hus was the point which prevented his success
in these intrigues, he wrote to the Bohemian nobles
assuring them that he deeply regretted that death,
that he had done his best to prevent it, and that, if
Hus had only consented to come under the Emperor’s
protection to Constance, instead of starting alone
from Prague, all would have been well; but he
added that he could not have saved Hus at the
last, without breaking up the Council altogether.
Whether these falsehoods deceived any one may be
doubted. At any rate they did not accomplish
Sigismund’s immediate purpose; for, when the
Bishop of Litomys̆l arrived, with authority from
the Council to suppress heresy in Bohemia, he received
no encouragement either from king or from
nobles, and, when he attempted violence, he was
driven out by force.</p>

<p>Indeed, whatever terms the nobles of Bohemia
might have thought right to make with Sigismund,
as the heir to the Bohemian throne, they could not,
with any credit to themselves, come to terms at
this time with the Council of Constance. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
same letter in which the nobles had condemned
the burning of Hus, they had also complained of
the imprisonment of Jerom; and with Jerom it was
clear that the Council were determined to proceed
to extremities. Worn with starvation and chains,
the unfortunate prisoner at last yielded to his persecutors;
and, while his countrymen were protesting
against his imprisonment, he had consented to recant
his errors, and to acknowledge the justice of
the death of Hus. The Italian cardinals now
desired to set him free; but the German and
Bohemian members of the Council, backed by the
Chancellor of the University of Paris, insisted that
this recantation was not to be trusted, and that
Jerom should be further examined as to his doctrines.
Michael de Causis and Stephen Pálec̆
fastened with relentless eagerness on their second
victim, and, by so doing, they saved his honour
and reputation, and gave him an opportunity of
showing his better side.</p>

<p>In May, 1416, he was granted a new hearing
before the Council; and, after having been for
some time pestered with questions, he was at last
allowed to speak for himself. His long oration,
filled with classical allusions, greatly impressed the
Italian scholar, Poggio Bracciolini, who was present
on this occasion. But it will scarcely strike modern
readers as so edifying as the simpler utterances of
Hus. The conclusion, however, was more worthy
of the occasion. It contained a manly and straightforward
eulogy on Hus, an expression of his deep
regret at the weakness which had led him to recant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and a declaration of his adherence to the teaching
both of Hus and of Wyclif. Then, on May 14,
1416, he was led out to be burnt, and went singing
to the stake.</p>

<p>If this execution had not been sufficient to prevent
a reconciliation between the Bohemians and
the Council of Constance, another event of the
same period would certainly have deepened the
division between them. The Bishop of Olmütz
died about this time, and Wenceslaus nominated a
new bishop in his stead. The Council, however, intervened;
and they not only rejected Wenceslaus’s
nominee, but they demanded that he should accept
instead that Bishop of Litomys̆l whom he had just
driven out of the country as a disturber of the
peace, and who was so deeply hated for his prominent
share in the condemnation of Hus. Wenceslaus
of course refused, and thereby widened the
gulf between himself and the orthodox Catholics.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the effect of this consolidation
of national feeling was speedily weakened
by the divisions which had begun to show themselves
in the Utraquist party. Teachers were coming
to the front who demanded far more sweeping
reforms than those which Jakaubek of Kladrau and
the other friends of Hus were at all disposed to
approve; and they wished to enforce these reforms
by the extremest violence. As these reforms were
aimed, not only at abuses in the Church, but also
at the influence of the wealthy men in the State, the
Reformers soon roused against them the fears and
anger of the well-to-do citizens of Prague. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
were these alarms likely to be modified when it
became evident that two men, at least, of important
position and remarkable ability, were disposed to
place themselves at the head of the reforming
movement.</p>

<p>The leader who first attracted the attention of
the crowd and the fears of the King was Nicholaus
of Hus, the Guardian of the Fortress of Hus, and
the proprietor of the village of Husinec. He had
been a favourite with the King, and was reputed,
even by his enemies, to be a man of great ability
and insight. He now gathered together such great
crowds of people for prayer and preaching that
Wenceslaus began to suspect him of aiming at the
throne. But the more pacific abilities of Nicholaus
were soon to be thrown into the shade by his
fiercer and more brilliant ally, John Z̆iz̆ka of Troc̆nov.</p>

<p>Though Z̆iz̆ka, like Nicholaus, had been a favourite
at Court, he had already once offended the king
by a daring act of independence. Influenced, no
doubt, by Sigismund and his friends, Wenceslaus
had at one time supported the Order of Teutonic
Knights in their struggle against the King of Poland.
The anti-German feeling in Bohemia was already
running high, even at that time; and sympathy with
their Slavonic kinsmen induced many Bohemian
officers to hasten to the support of the Poles, in
opposition to the wish of the King. In this semi-rebellious
movement Z̆iz̆ka had taken a prominent
part; but he had, since then, been pardoned and
received back into favour. His independent spirit,
however, was ill-suited to a Court life, and he was
not long in giving new offence to Wenceslaus.</p>

<p class="caption">MARKET-PLACE OF PRACHATICE, THE TOWN WHERE HUS AND Z̆IZ̆KA WENT TO SCHOOL.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>Tradition gives an early date to the first signs of
sympathy between Z̆iz̆ka and Hus. Within a walk
of the village of Husinec stands the old town of
Prachatice, where the ruins are still shown of the
school in which Z̆iz̆ka and Hus are said to have
studied together. However this may be, there can
be no doubt that it was very soon after the death of
Hus that Z̆iz̆ka began to assume that position of
leadership among the extremer Utraquists, which
ultimately gained him such fame both among friends
and enemies. This section of Reformers had already
discovered that they did not receive that sympathy
from the citizens of Prague which they believed to
be their due. Many of them were compelled to
leave the city; and they gathered together on a
mountain near Austi, to which they gave the name
of Tabor, and to which their supporters gradually
flocked from all parts of the kingdom. These
gatherings so alarmed Wenceslaus that they even
weakened his hostility to the Council of Constance;
and not only the followers of Nicholaus and Z̆iz̆ka,
but even some of the more moderate Utraquists
became objects of his suspicion.</p>

<p>This change of feeling naturally increased the
hopes of Sigismund, and he became even more
sanguine of success, and more bitter against the
followers of Hus, when the Council of Constance
elected, under the name of Pope Martin V., that
Cardinal Colonna, who had urged upon John XXIII.
the first proposal for the condemnation of Hus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Under the influence of this new Pope, all the schemes
of reform, which the Council had once thought of
considering, were sacrificed to the one aim of the
suppression of heresy; and in April, 1418, the Pope
secured himself a freer hand by dissolving the Council
of Constance.</p>

<p>Urged, then, by pressure from Emperor and Pope,
and by his own fear of Utraquistic excesses, Wenceslaus
banished one of the Reformers from Prague, and
recalled the Catholic clergy, who had been expelled
from the city. He discovered, indeed, that Utraquism
had taken so deep a root in Prague that it would be
necessary to grant at least three churches to its
preachers. But this concession did not satisfy the
more zealous champions of the cause; and the
favour shown by the King to the Catholics provoked
riots among the Reformers. Then Wenceslaus
demanded that the citizens should all give up their
arms to him.</p>

<p>Z̆iz̆ka now saw that the controversy with the
Catholics must sooner or later end in war; and he
was determined that his followers should not be unprovided
for such a struggle. He therefore resolved
to obey the royal summons, but in a peculiar manner
of his own. He gathered together his followers, led
them into the presence of the King, and assured him
that they were ready to stand by him, with life and
property, against his enemies. The unfortunate
Wenceslaus felt bound to thank Z̆iz̆ka and his
followers for this loyal declaration; but Z̆iz̆ka knew
well enough that he had thereby forfeited the royal
favour. He therefore quickly retired from Court,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and joined Nicholaus of Hus in organising their
followers on Mount Tabor. The alarm of Wenceslaus
was naturally increased by these proceedings;
and he began to meet the opposition by deposing
the Town Councillors in the different divisions of
Prague, and thrusting in their opponents. This was
a more arbitrary act of power than he had yet
resorted to in this struggle; and it naturally hastened
on the violent crisis which had long been approaching.</p>

<p>The quarter in which the outbreak finally took
place had a peculiar character of its own, which some
historians believe to have affected the character of
the coming struggle. It will be remembered that
Charles IV. had done much, not merely to develop
the intellectual greatness of Prague, but also to
increase its physical size. A completely new suburb
had been added during that reign, which was known
as the New Town of Prague. This division of the
city was governed by its own Council, and rapidly
assumed a peculiar character. Charles’s policy attracted
many Germans to the city; and, while the
more prominent struggle between the rival “Nations”
of the University had been growing in intensity, it is
believed by some that an equally bitter feeling had
been springing up among those Bohemian workmen
who had fallen under the rule of German employers
of labour. The historians who hold this view maintain
that the workmen, who desired to escape from
this domination, fled from the older parts of Prague,
and found new possibilities of life and of organisation
in the New Town. Whether this migration can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
clearly proved or no, it is certain that, both at this
and later crises, there appears a more democratic
and, in some respects, a more national spirit in the
movements which had their rise in the New Town,
than in those of other parts of the city.</p>

<p>It was then, in the church of St. Stephen, in the
New Town, that on the 30th of July, 1419, a fiery
preacher named John of Seelau (Zelív) delivered a
sermon in the presence of an excited crowd of the
followers of Z̆iz̆ka. After being worked up by
pictures of the coming judgment, these fiery reformers
marched in procession through the streets.
As they passed the Council House, some insult
appears to have been offered them by those who
were looking out of the windows; whereupon the
infuriated Utraquists rushed upstairs into the council
chamber, and hurled the newly-elected Councillors
from the window, the crowd below receiving the
falling men on the points of their spikes. Then
Z̆iz̆ka and his friends proceeded to seize the town
into their hands, elected four captains for each
district, and appointed Councillors in the place of
those who had been killed.</p>

<p>Wenceslaus was furious at this news, and vowed
that he would exterminate all Wyclifites and Hussites.
Many of his advisers, however, were still in sympathy
with the principle of Utraquism; and they
persuaded the King to come to terms with the rioters,
and to confirm the election of the new Councillors.
The excitement of the controversy and the humiliation
of this confession were too much for the strength
of Wenceslaus. He was seized with a fever; and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
August, 1419, ended at last his long and tragic
reign.</p>

<p>The concessions into which Wenceslaus had been
persuaded by his queen and his nobles, produced less
effect on the minds of the citizens of Prague than the
violent threats which had preceded them; and, at
the time of his death, the feeling against him was so
fierce that his friends did not venture to give him a
public funeral, but buried him secretly by night. A
still plainer evidence of this feeling was shown in the
renewal of the riots against the monks. Altars,
organs, and images of saints were destroyed; and
many of the monks were driven out of the city.</p>

<p>Several of the nobles who had been hitherto
inclined to the Utraquist cause, were so much
alarmed at these excesses that they called upon
Sigismund, as next heir to the throne, to hasten to
Bohemia, to restore order. The messengers found
him preparing to start on an expedition against the
Turks; and his German and Hungarian councillors
persuaded him to delay his visit to Bohemia, until he
could enter it at the head of a victorious army. He
therefore appointed Wenceslaus’s widow Sophia as
regent in his place; and he chose a council to assist
her, of which the most prominent member was C̆enĕk
of Wartenberg.</p>

<p>C̆enĕk was one of those men who will always
receive more condemnation and less pity than are
their due. He was evidently a man of some attractive
qualities, and, originally at least, of excellent intentions.
He had taken the lead in the protest against
the execution of Hus; and, if he had shown himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
somewhat too tolerant towards the early excesses of
Z̆iz̆ka and his friends, he had at least helped to
preserve Wenceslaus from being driven by those acts
into the arms of Sigismund. But to steer the kingdom
through the dangers with which it was threatened
by the fierce intolerance of Sigismund on the one
hand, and of Z̆iz̆ka on the other, required stronger
nerve and clearer purpose than C̆enĕk possessed; and
thus his continual changes of party were effected in
a manner which have left a deep stain on his memory.</p>

<p>When the Bohemian Assembly first met to consider
the position of affairs, it seemed as if the
moderate Utraquists would be able to carry the
day; for a resolution was passed that the Estates
would only consent to the coronation of Sigismund
on the following conditions: First, that he would
permit the Communion in both kinds to be celebrated
in all the churches, and would try to procure the
sanction of the Pope to this practice. Secondly,
that he would place no clergy in temporal authority.
Thirdly, that he would not permit the publication of
any Papal Bulls until they had received the approval
of the King’s Council. Fourthly, that he would not
appoint any foreigners to either temporal or spiritual
offices, nor set German magistrates over towns where
Bohemians dwelt. Lastly, that the proceedings of
the law-courts should be conducted in the Bohemian
language. These were the principal demands of the
nobles; but the citizens of Prague, who were daily
gaining greater influence in the councils of the State,
added certain conditions of their own. These were
that Sigismund should grant an amnesty for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
recent disturbances; that he should not permit the
establishment in Prague of any more houses of ill-fame;
and that he should permit the reading of at
least the Gospel and Epistle in the Bohemian language.
Such a programme might seem to unite for the
moment all sections of Bohemians who desired peace
and independence for their country; but, when
Sigismund replied by putting aside the whole of
these demands, and declaring that he would only
promise to govern as his father had governed before
him, the situation was entirely changed.</p>

<p>Strange as it sounds, in speaking of so turbulent a
country, it is none the less true that, till this time,
there had been no instance of a combined national
resistance in Bohemia to a King who was the sole
lawful claimant of the throne. There had been
plenty of instances of setting up rival members of
the royal family against each other; attempts by
discontented nobles to call in a foreign King or
Emperor to their help; and even something like a
provincial insurrection of Moravia against Bohemia;
but that the National Assembly of Bohemia should
formally commit itself to an attempt to exclude from
the country the lawful heir to the throne, who was at
once the only living representative of the House of
Luxemburg, and the ruler of the Holy Roman
Empire&mdash;this was a step so unprecedented that it
may well have caused hesitation in those who were
called upon to take it.</p>

<p>Doubtless this difficulty might have been avoided
if Sophia could have ventured on more independent
action. But the Queen, though she had exercised so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
useful an influence over her husband during his lifetime,
seems, after his death, to have fallen completely
into the background, and to have taken her cue from
Sigismund, or from his principal advisers.</p>

<p>The result, then, of the deliberations of the Bohemian
Assembly was that the nation was broken up into
three parties. These were as follows: (1) The
Catholic Party, which was in favour of complete submission
to Sigismund. (2) The Moderate Utraquist
Party which would have accepted him if he would
have granted some amount of religious liberty. (3)
The Extreme Reforming Party, which thoroughly
distrusted Sigismund, and desired to throw off his
authority. The first of these parties found its supporters
chiefly in Moravia, and particularly in the
German-speaking districts of that province. By a
strange irony of fortune, its leader was that Wenceslaus
of Duba who had stood so gallantly by Hus
at the Council of Constance. But though he, and
one or two others of the party, may have cherished
some national aspirations, they were, as a body, too
much out of sympathy with the keen Slavonic feeling
of the country to be reckoned as a Bohemian party
at all. The second party, which gradually acquired
the name of Calixtines, from the importance which
they attached to the custom of granting the Cup to
the laity, were really composed of two very different
elements. Many of the great nobles, while theoretically
zealous for the Cup, were far more anxious to
maintain that position in the country which largely
depended on the favour of the king; while, on the
other hand, learned preachers like Jakaubek of Kladrau
were as zealous for the reforms which they desired as
many of the extremer Utraquists could be, and would
have risked and sacrificed as much to secure them.</p>

from the third Bohemian party that there were to be
drawn the most determined fighters, and the most
impressive figures, in the struggle of Bohemia against
the German Emperor. This party had been founded
by those fiery spirits who had been banished from
Prague by Wenceslaus; and they derived their name
of Taborite from the mountain which they had made
their chief place of refuge after their expulsion from
Prague. So great was the enthusiasm which they
caused that, when Wenceslaus forbade any further
visits to Tabor under penalty of death and confiscation
of goods, large numbers of the peasantry
willingly sacrificed all their possessions, and risked
the chance of death, to unite themselves with this
chosen band. A community so formed naturally
developed very remarkable qualities; and a stern
Puritanical gloom, combined with the Puritanical
nobleness of aspiration, rapidly showed itself among
them. Rich and poor shared their food with each
other; no strife or theft was permitted; intoxicating
liquors were excluded from the mountain; and not
only was gambling forbidden to the elders, but even
the children were deprived of their games. Such is
the account given of the Taborites by a somewhat
hostile chronicler, who thus proceeds to describe their
manner of passing the day:</p>

<p>“Having then completed the moderate refreshment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
of the body, the priests rise with the people to give
thanks to God. They march round the Mount of
Tabor, bearing the venerable Eucharist&mdash;the virgins
preceding the Sacrament, and the men and women
in their squadrons following, all shouting and singing
psalms as seems convenient. When this procession
is finished, they exchange farewells with their clergy,
not bending to the right or left lest they should
trample on the wheat; and so they come to the place
whence they started.” These people, already prepared
for religious enthusiasm by the stern discipline
of such a life as this, were kindled yet further by
fiery sermons, founded chiefly on the visions of the
Apocalypse, in which prophecies were delivered of
the speedy coming of Christ, and the reign of the
Saints, which was to be hastened by the putting to
death of the enemies of Christ. They were told that
they were to bathe and sanctify their hands in the
blood of their enemies; and that, while they were to
imitate the zeal and indignation of their Master, this
was not the time to imitate His gentleness. All
human learning, said the fiercer of the preachers, was
to be treated with contempt; and the taking of
degrees at the University was a vanity.</p>

<p>Nor was it only the training, which they had
received from their preachers, that prepared the
Taborites for the part which they were to play in
the coming struggle. Z̆iz̆ka was eminently fitted to
be the hero of a revolutionary party. To a fiery
sincerity, and a steady devotion to that high ideal
of life which was implied in the Taborite creed, he
united a genius for leadership and organisation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the greatest generals might have envied; a statesmanlike
instinct for seizing the right moment and the
right course of action; and a savage ferocity which
none of his opponents could surpass.</p>

</div>

<p>But, though this fiery band, and their uncompromising
leader, were to give the tone to the struggle
which was fast approaching, one passing hint was
given, before the outbreak of the war, of the presence
among the Bohemians of gentler spirits who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
gain a hearing at a later and more appropriate time.
One or more of those Taborites, who had not imbibed
that contempt for learning which had been inculcated
by their wilder preachers, applied to the Masters of
the Prague University, to know whether war on behalf
of religion was not forbidden by the command to
Peter to put up his sword into his sheath. Jakaubek
answered, on behalf of his colleagues, that, though
a war for the propagation of the Faith was undoubtedly
forbidden to Christians, yet a defensive
war for the protection of the Faith was certainly
lawful.</p>

<p>This question, as has been already suggested, has
more importance as a prophecy of future religious
developments than as a characteristic utterance of the
period. But the answer has a more immediate significance,
as indicating a policy which was to separate the
learned professors of the University from the more
aristocratic section of the Calixtines. This difference
has already been referred to above; but it requires to
be emphasized and developed. In the case of C̆enek
of Wartenberg the difference seems to have been
partly due to a sense of loyalty to the House of
Luxemburg, and to a shrinking from some of the
violences in which the Taborites indulged. But
C̆enek’s prominent position in his party was not due
solely to his personal qualities or even to his personal
rank. It was also largely derived from the guardianship
which he possessed over the lands of Rosenberg;
and this position must also be considered as colouring
the character of his policy.</p>

<p>Ulric von Rosenberg, like his guardian C̆enek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
played a somewhat questionable and uncertain part
in the coming struggle. But the times and circumstances
of his changes of position lead one to attribute
to him somewhat different motives of action from those
which influenced his guardian. He seems to have
begun his career as a decided Utraquist; but his
subsequent oppressions of his Utraquist dependents
show a bitterer change of feeling than can be laid to
the charge of C̆enek; while his special opposition to
Z̆iz̆ka seems to mark the real ground of his questionable
policy. In mere doctrine he may have had some
sympathy with the reforming movement; but he was
soon alarmed by the democratic character of the
Taborite party and of its leader; and the great
power which had been so long wielded by the
Rosenbergs, was thrown, in the main, into the defence
of aristocratic privileges and feudal rights. For the
moment, however, the nobles could put forward the
excuse that they were supporting the claims of a
Queen, who was not stained with the blood of Hus,
nor committed to an anti-national policy; and, it was
on her behalf that C̆enek now organised a standing
army, and seized into his hands several important
fortresses.</p>

<p>Z̆iz̆ka, on his part, felt that no time was to be lost
in saving the cause for which he desired to struggle.
So, at the head of a band of his drilled peasants, he
suddenly marched upon the fortress of the Vys̆ehrad,
drove out the royalist garrison, and put his own men
in their place. Then, on the 10th of November, the
Taborites set out in various bands, from the three or
four towns which were occupied by their party; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
they marched to Prague, to hold a great meeting
there. The main body met at the town of Zinkov,
where they organised their forces before proceeding on
their march. But three hundred men had started alone
from Austi, apparently ill-armed and ill-prepared for
attack. This detached body was met on its way by
one of the royalist nobles; and on the first attack he
put to flight the men of Austi with much slaughter.</p>

<p>The fugitives escaped to Knin, at which point the
main body of their friends had now arrived. Baron
von Sternberg, the general of the royalists, marched
thither to meet the advancing Taborites, and probably
hoped to obtain an easy victory. But the sturdy
peasants repelled his attack with such vigour that the
royalists were forced to retreat; and on the 4th of
November, 1419, the Taborites entered Prague without
further opposition. The royalist party were at
once called to arms; while, on the other side, Nicholaus
of Hus and Z̆iz̆ka marched into the Small Division
of Prague, and, after a fierce struggle, seized upon the
great fortress, which still overlooks the town. The
Queen fled from Prague under the protection of Ulric
of Rosenberg. C̆enek in the meantime gathered new
forces on her behalf, and persuaded several towns to
declare for the royalist cause.</p>

<p>Each party was now conscious of the strength of
its opponents; and, under such circumstances, those
moderate citizens of Prague who combined a zeal for
freedom with a desire for peace, were able to hold the
balance between the contending parties. So a compromise
was effected, by which the queen and the
nobles were pledged to protect religious liberty and
especially Communion in both kinds; while the
citizens, on their part, consented to restore the
fortress of Vys̆ehrad to the Queen, and to abstain
from any injuries to churches or images. Z̆iz̆ka,
however, distrusted the Queen’s party, and was
discontented with these terms. So he withdrew with most
of his troops to his chief fortress of Pilsen (Plz̆en).</p>

<p class="caption">TOWN COUNCIL HOUSE OF PILSEN (PLZEN).</p>

</div>

<p>Although the recovery of the Vys̆ehrad was an
important gain to the royalist cause, the great centre
of the extreme Catholic feeling was the town of
Kutna Hora. That town, from its importance as a
mining centre, and from the special favour shown to
it by the kings, had become a kind of rival to Prague;
and in a time of civil war such rivalry naturally
ripened into active hostility of the fiercest description.
In spite of the occasional fierceness of such outbursts
as that which had produced the slaughter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Councillors of the New Town, there had been, till
now, little organised cruelty in the contest between
the two parties. Now, however, whether actuated by
municipal rivalry or religious hostility, the men of
Kutna Hora began to inaugurate a system of persecution
which was to produce terrible reprisals. They
seized upon all the Utraquists whom they could find,
and even paid other towns so much a head to send
them victims. Some of these they buried alive in pits;
some they burnt, and some they beheaded; so that
in a short time more than sixteen hundred had been
put to death.</p>

<p>In the meantime Sigismund had returned from
Hungary to Moravia; and in Christmas, 1419, he and
Queen Sophia held a meeting at Brünn (Brno). The
citizens of Prague sent a deputation to this assembly
to entreat for terms of peace. Sigismund ordered
them at once to pull down all the chains which they
had placed across the streets; to destroy all their
new fortifications; and to bring back the Catholic
priests who had been driven out. The citizens were
so anxious to avoid a collision with Sigismund that
they consented to these terms; and they destroyed
their fortifications amid the jeers of the Catholics and
Germans.</p>

<p>Z̆iz̆ka now fully realised the impossibility of any
compromise, and he prepared for a desperate struggle.
His first intention had been to make the town of
Pilsen the centre of his operations. From that town
he had succeeded in driving out all the Catholics;
and its fortifications were so strong that he hoped to
make it good against all comers. But the growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
strength of the fortress of Tabor led him to change
his opinion; and he decided to withdraw from Pilsen,
and to concentrate the whole force of his followers on
the mountain from which they took their name.
According to one account, the divisions in Pilsen
itself were the main cause of this decision. Certainly
some special explanation is needed of a step which
proved, in one way, so disastrous to the reforming
cause; for, during all the victories gained by the
Utraquists, they were never able to recover this
important fortress again.</p>

<p>It was not, however, unconditionally that Z̆iz̆ka
consented to abandon this position. He stipulated
that he should be allowed to depart freely to Tabor,
and that the granting of the Cup to the laity should
be permitted in Pilsen. Wenceslaus of Duba, as
leader of the Catholic forces, consented to the terms
which Z̆iz̆ka proposed. Unfortunately, however, the
doctrine that faith should not be kept with heretics
had already taken deep root amongst the opponents
of the Utraquists. While Z̆iz̆ka was still on his way
from Pilsen to Tabor, he was attacked by Peter of
Sternberg, at the head of a royalist force. Unprepared
for this attack, and very inferior in the number
of his forces, Z̆iz̆ka at first retreated before his
enemies; but, finding himself compelled to fight, he
took up his position on the bank of a fish-pond near
the town of Sudomír. There, for the first time, he
adopted the plan which became a special characteristic
of his battles. He entrenched himself behind
his baggage-waggons, over which his men fired at the
advancing foe. The struggle was a fierce one; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
at last the royalists were compelled to retreat, and
Z̆iz̆ka went on in safety to Tabor.</p>

<p>But though much of the success of the Utraquist
wars was due to the energy of Z̆iz̆ka and his followers,
the leading citizens of Prague had also a very
important influence on the struggle; and Sigismund’s
actions soon roused in them that desperate
courage which had seemed for a moment to forsake
them. The nickname of Sigismund, “Super Grammaticam,”
has been fixed on this Emperor by Carlyle;
but an even more distinctive name would have been
Sigismund “Super Veritatem.” Many other rulers
have told lies in their time of emergency; but surely
no one ever took so much pains to write himself down
a liar as Sigismund did at every stage of his career.
It will be remembered that he had written most
urgently to the Bohemians, to express his regret for
the death of Hus, and to assure them that he had
done all he could to prevent it. Yet, as soon as Pope
Martin had published his Bull, urging a crusade
against the Hussites, Sigismund seized upon a
merchant of Prague named Krasa, and publicly
burnt him in Breslau, on the express ground that
he had disapproved of the burning of Hus and
Jerom.</p>

<p>C̆enek of Wartenberg, who had been entrusted by
Sigismund with the care of the fortress of Prague,
now declared that he could no longer serve the king.
At nearly every stage in the career of this unfortunate
nobleman, his change of opinion, however excusable
in itself, was stained by some act of treachery. On
this occasion he invited the subordinate governors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the castle to dinner, and seized that opportunity for
arresting and imprisoning them. Having thus
mastered the castle, he placed it under the care of
the citizens of Prague. He then arrested seventy-six
of the clergy, and drove several of the opposing
citizens from the town.</p>

<p>But C̆enek was never long of one mind; and he
soon began to despair of the struggle on which he
had entered. On the one hand the Catholic defenders
of the Vys̆ehrad held out successfully against his
attacks; and at the same time he seems to have been
sincerely shocked at the outrages committed by the
Taborites. In the early outbursts, though there had
been much plundering and some bloodshed, there had
been little deliberate cruelty. Now, however, Z̆iz̆ka
began to imitate only too closely the cruelties of the
Kuttenberger; for finding a number of monks in a
castle which he had stormed, he burnt them alive
after the victory was over. When this cruelty was
followed by the destruction of many churches and
monasteries, C̆enek began to shrink from the cause
which he had defended, and to urge the citizens of
Prague to come to terms with Sigismund. Finding,
however, that he was unable to persuade them to
take this course, he resolved secretly to betray the
castle to Sigismund, on the understanding that the
Communion in both kinds should be permitted on
C̆enek’s own estates. Sigismund apparently consented
to this arrangement; and C̆enek secretly admitted
into the castle four thousand of the royalist soldiers,
of whom many were Germans. Furious at this
treachery, the citizens made so fierce an attack upon
the castle that C̆enek was panic-struck and fled
secretly to Sigismund. But the attack was made
without organisation or arrangement and the citizens
were repelled.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CASTLE OF PRAGUE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>Several noblemen had followed C̆enek in his desertion
of the national cause; and at last the citizens
decided to send a new embassy to Sigismund, under
the protection of Wenceslaus of Duba. Sigismund’s
hope and indignation had alike been raised by the
recent events; and he demanded that the citizens
should surrender all their arms to the defenders of
the Vys̆ehrad. On receiving this demand, the Town
Council of Prague sent defiance to the king, and
resolved to fight till the last.</p>

<p>Both parties now prepared for action; and, while
Sigismund was issuing an appeal to all citizens and
princes to come to help him against his rebellious
subjects, Z̆iz̆ka and Nicholaus of Hus were preparing
to march to Prague at the head of their Taborite
forces. Many of the workmen and peasants were
now beginning to stir themselves for the national
cause; and, before Sigismund could secure the help
of the Electors of the Empire, he was to have a slight
taste of the dangers which he was about to encounter.
The Kutna Hora miners had roused much opposition
by their cruelties on behalf of the royalist cause;
and the charcoal burners, who had hitherto been
dependent upon them, had now revolted against
them. After vainly attempting to pacify their new
opponents, the Kuttenberger appealed to Sigismund,
and he sent them a detachment of the royal troops.
The charcoal burners met the soldiers with stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and arrows; and, cheered on by a Taborite priest,
they drove back the royalists in confusion to the
mountains. The priest, however, was wounded; and
the charcoal burners then retreated.</p>

<p>In the meantime Z̆iz̆ka and his forces were on
their march. Their importance was now recognised
by their opponents; and Wenceslaus of Duba attempted
to intercept them. Z̆iz̆ka encountered the
royalists near Porc̆ic, signally defeated them, and
entered Prague in triumph on the 20th of May, 1420.</p>

<p>The powerful help of the new-comers was doubtless
welcomed by the citizens of Prague; but they
speedily discovered that differences of habit and
feeling were likely to produce as many difficulties in
the relations of the two parties to each other, as had
already been produced by differences of doctrine.
Both sections of the Utraquist Party had desired to
introduce a purer life and simpler habits; and in
many cases they had taken steps to enforce them.
But the Taborite ideal, and still more the Taborite
methods of realising it, differed considerably from
those of the comfortable and orderly citizens of
Prague. The latter, it appeared, indulged in delicately
trimmed beards and moustachios; their wives wore
trains, which seemed to the Taborites unduly long;
and the hair of the younger ladies fell in long and
curiously made plaits on their shoulders. The sturdy
peasant reformers resolved summarily to correct these
evils; so they seized the citizens in the streets, and
compulsorily shaved them, cut off the trains of their
wives’ dresses, and even shortened the locks of the
girls. The citizens naturally objected to such strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
methods of reform; and the Taborite captains cut
short these proceedings by sending their followers to
dig trenches for the defence of the town.</p>

<p>But the value of the new defenders was soon
proved; for a force of royalist troops on their way
to the castle at Prague, were completely cut to pieces
by a sally of the Taborites; and when Sigismund at
last advanced against the city, the approach of this
fierce peasant army, wielding the spiked flails which
were generally their only weapon, struck him with
such fear that he at once abandoned the siege of
Prague, and devoted himself to more easy enterprises.
Nor were the nobles of Bohemia more fortunate in
their efforts. Ulric of Rosenberg, who had followed
C̆enek in his desertion of the popular cause, was
driven back from Tabor by Nicholaus of Hus, and
confined himself for a time to imprisoning and
starving the Utraquist priests whom he found on his
lands.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the appeal of the Pope and the
Emperor for a crusade against the Utraquists was
producing its effect. Not only from Germany, but
from various parts of Hungary, Spain, France,
England, and Holland, and in some cases even
from Poland, trained warriors came to join Sigismund’s
army.</p>

<p>Prominent amongst the German princes was
Frederick of Hohenzollern. He had been secured
to Sigismund’s cause by a transaction which roused
new bitterness in Bohemia against the Emperor. It
may be remembered that Charles IV. had added
Brandenburg to the Bohemian kingdom. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
of S̆títný, and other stern moralists, had objected to
this acquisition, considering it as a mere act of personal
aggrandisement, and of no real benefit to the
kingdom. But, in the history of every country,
there have been additions of territory which, however
questionable in their origin, have afterwards
roused on their behalf a strong national feeling. Nor
must it be forgotten that the circumstances, under
which Sigismund surrendered this territory, certainly
justified considerable indignation on the part of the
Bohemians. In 1415, four years before he was
actually King of Bohemia, without any consultation
with Wenceslaus or the Bohemian Assembly, Sigismund
handed over Brandenburg to Frederick of
Hohenzollern, whose ancestor had so actively assisted
Rudolf in the conquest of Bohemia.</p>

<p>It soon appeared that the national feeling against
Germans in general, and the Hohenzollerns in particular,
was not limited to the Utraquists, but was
shared even by those Bohemian nobles who followed
Sigismund in battle. So intense was this hatred that
the Bohemians and their allies had to be quartered
in different parts of the field; and doubtless this
disagreement was one cause of the strange delay in
the operations of the army which followed their
arrival before Prague. Two weeks were spent by
the captains of the host in raids upon the neighbouring
towns, whence they brought in Utraquist priests
whom they burnt in the camp. One occasion is
specially noted by the chronicler, in which three old
men and four boys were brought in, in company with
their priest. These prisoners, after having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
struck and insulted for some time, were ordered to
abjure the practice of Communion in both kinds, and
when they refused, were burnt. During all this time
Z̆iz̆ka was working at the fortifications of a hill which
overlooks the town, and from which he hoped to
conduct the defence.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>At last, on the 14th of July, the invading army
grew weary of its delays, and prepared for a general
attack on various parts of the city. In this plan the
invaders were to be aided by the garrisons which
occupied respectively the fortress of the Vys̆ehrad
and the castle of Prague. The battle began by an
attempt to storm the hill which Z̆iz̆ka had fortified.
This attack was undertaken by the Margrave of
Meissen, the hereditary enemy of the Bohemians.
As his soldiers charged up the hill they were encountered,
not only by Z̆iz̆ka’s forces, but also by
private citizens, and even by women. The stones
hurled by these defenders produced such effect that
the first attack was repelled. But the Germans
quickly returned to the charge; nor could the
desperate courage of the defenders wholly prevent
their advance. One of the Germans seized on a
woman who was defending the hill; but she vowed
that she would not yield to anti-Christ, and she was
killed in defending herself. Still the invaders pressed
on. Z̆iz̆ka was himself wounded and struck down,
and was with difficulty rescued by the flails of his
followers. The Germans had almost reached the
top of the hill, when suddenly the gate of the city,
which stood nearest to the hill on the other side, was
thrown open, and a priest came out bearing the
Sacrament, and followed by fifty archers, and some
more of the flail-bearing peasants. At the same
moment all the bells in the city were set ringing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and, with a great shout, echoed from within the
walls, the new-comers rushed up the hill to meet the
advancing enemy. Immediately the invaders were
seized with a panic and fled; three hundred of
them were killed in the descent, and others dangerously
wounded. Sigismund’s forces retreated to their
tents, and the citizens of Prague hastened to their
churches to return thanks for their victory. The
scene of this battle was called by some Bojiste (the
battlefield) in consequence of the great slaughter
of the Germans; others called it the Hill of the Cup;
but the name which has driven out every other is
that which connects it with the general of the day;
and it is still known as Z̆iz̆kov Hora&mdash;the hill of
Z̆iz̆ka.</p>

<p>It might have seemed that such a victory, however
startling, would scarcely have ended a war, begun
with so great preparation, and engaged in by so
formidable an army. But the bitter feeling between
the German and Bohemian Royalists had now risen
to such a height as to make common action impossible.
On the one hand, the Germans furiously
accused the Bohemians of having betrayed them in the
battle; and, in revenge for this supposed treachery,
they attacked and burnt some of the houses in the
outlying villages, and threw the women and children
into the fire. The Bohemians, on the other hand,
were more and more disposed to make peace with
their countrymen; and it will be remembered that
some of the nobles had already shown an inclination
to Utraquism. As for Sigismund, his first and main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
thought was to secure the crown of Bohemia to himself
with the smallest amount of trouble.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the Bohemian part of
the army willingly entered into negotiations with the
defenders of the city; and the latter proposed, for
Sigismund’s acceptance, four Articles of Peace, which
were to become very famous in the following years.
The first of these was the free preaching of the
Word of God; the second, the granting of the Cup to
the laity; the third, the removal of the clergy from
rule in secular affairs, and their restriction to the
apostolic mode of life; the fourth was the public
suppression of deadly sins. Sigismund consented to
discussion on these points between the Utraquist
preachers and the Catholic priests, who had followed
his army. The leading orator on the Utraquist side
was John Pr̆zibram, a man who was to play a conspicuous
part in the coming controversies.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, it was found that the Catholic
clergy were willing to make many concessions in the
discussion. But the Conference broke down on a
point which may be called the main issue of the
Later Reformation&mdash;the question, namely, whether,
in cases of doubt, the deciding authority should be
the Church or the Scriptures. Perhaps few could
have expected that the clerical disputants would have
come to an agreement; and the Bohemian Royalists
did not seem to have been shaken by this result in
their desire for peace. Indeed, such readiness did
they show to accept the Four Articles, that the
citizens of Prague considered their cause secure, and
consented to elect Sigismund as their King. So on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
July 28, 1420, Sigismund, having given a general
promise to govern better, was solemnly crowned at
Prague; and two days later the great army of
Crusaders returned, cursing the King as a breaker
of his word and a favourer of heretics.</p>

<h2>X.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE FIRST CORONATION OF SIGISMUND TO
THE OPENING OF COUNCIL OF BASEL.<br />
(1420-1431.)</span></h2>

<p>In spite of the dramatic circumstances of Sigismund’s
coronation at Prague, any hopes of peace
or reconciliation, which the citizens may have entertained,
at the moment, were speedily to be frustrated,
partly by the bitter divisions in the Utraquist
camp, partly by the incurably untrustworthy character
of the king whom they had chosen. The former
difficulty was the one which first forced itself on
public attention. The Taborites had taken the leading
part in the victory which had just been won;
and they resolved that their will should be felt in the
settlement which was to follow it. Furious at the
recent burning of their friends before the very eyes
of the citizens, they demanded that these murders
should be revenged by the burning of the prisoners
who had been taken in the battle; and the rulers of
the city yielded to their wishes. Elated by this
success, the Taborites insisted that twelve new
Articles should be added to the four which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
already set forth by the Calixtines. Most of these
new proposals were in the direction of more vigorous
provisions for punishing self-indulgence and immorality.
But the bitter national feeling manifests itself
in the demand for the complete establishment of the
law of God, in the place of those pagan and <i>Teutonic</i>
laws, which do not agree with the laws of God.
Further, all the revenues of the priests were to be
seized for the public good; usury was to be suppressed;
all enemies of the truth to be expelled; all
heretical monasteries and all unnecessary churches,
altars, and ornaments to be destroyed.</p>

<p>The discussion of these proposals was marked by
the first public appearance in Bohemia of a man who
was to play a remarkable part in the coming struggle.
This was Peter Payne, an English Master of Arts,
who had been forced to fly from Oxford on account
of his sympathy with the doctrines of Wyclif. He
had been welcomed by the scholars of Prague, and
had been admitted to a Master’s Degree at their
University also. Although his doctrinal Protestantism
had led him to conclusions far beyond those adopted
by any Bohemian party, yet his English sense of
justice and love of compromise often marked him
out as a go-between and moderator in the controversies
of his adopted countrymen. He now came
forward to suggest the senses in which the Articles
of the Taborites might be accepted, without injury
to either party. But, although the Calixtines were
anxious to find a method of reconciliation with the
Taborites, the latter were guided on this occasion by
much fiercer spirits than Peter Payne.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>The chief of these extreme advisers was John of
Z̆elív, who had so excited the Utraquists, on the
occasion of that first riot, when the Councillors of
the New Town were thrown out of the windows. He
now demanded the deposition of those Councillors of
the Old Town who were opposed to the Taborite
doctrines. This point, too, was conceded; yet, for
some reason, not clearly ascertainable, the Taborites
were still dissatisfied, and on August 22nd they left
Prague.</p>

<p>But the second hindrance to the establishment of
peace in Bohemia was to have an even more marked
effect in hastening on the new war. It was not only
the Taborites who distrusted their new ruler; Sigismund
soon provoked against him many of those who
had been most desirous for peace. One of the first
points which roused their opposition, was his demand
that the ornaments of the churches and the royal
treasure should be used for the payment of the foreign
soldiers, who had just been employed in the invasion
of Bohemia. He also began to renew the old and
evil policy of pledging the monasteries and the royal
castles to the nobles. Lastly, although he had encouraged
the citizens to hope that he would sanction
the Four Articles, he still declined to give them any
formal approval, or even to make arrangements for a
discussion upon them; nor would he give the citizens
any security against the attacks of those fierce
Catholics who still held the fortresses of Prague
and Vys̆ehrad. These divisions of opinions were
obviously too vital to permit of any friendly understanding
between the two parties. So Sigismund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
soon after left Prague; and the suspicions between
king and people rapidly ripened to a violent solution
of their differences.</p>

<p>Sigismund had now adopted, to the full, the principle
that no faith was to be kept with heretics; and,
while he assured the Praguer of his desire for peace,
he was appealing to the Pope and the electors to join
a second crusade for the suppression of the heretics.
The citizens first fully realised the treacherous character
of Sigismund’s policy when they began to renew
their attacks on the Vys̆ehrad. The possession of
this fortress by the Catholics was a continual danger
to the city; yet, when the Utraquists sent their next
deputation to Sigismund, to entreat its acceptance of
the Four Articles, he demanded that, even before the
Articles should be discussed, the citizens of Prague
should abandon their siege of the Vys̆ehrad. This
demand received a still more startling interpretation
a short time after, when the Town Council intercepted
a letter from the king to the defenders of the fortress,
urging them to make a sudden attack on the city,
which he would second from another point.</p>

<p>With some difficulty the citizens now persuaded
Nicholaus of Hus to bring a force of the Taborites
to their help. The king had secretly arranged to
send ships down the Moldau to the defence of the
Vys̆ehrad; and the citizens had put chains across the
island which lies below the fortress, so as to hinder
the ships from passing. Nicholaus was set to guard
this island; but not even the sense of a common
danger could stifle the differences between the Calixtine
leaders and the captains of the Taborites. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Royalists, in their fear of starvation, offered to surrender
the Vys̆ehrad, if the king did not relieve them
within a certain time. This proposal the citizens
were willing to accept; but Nicholaus was so indignant
at the terms granted to the garrison, that he
abandoned the island and retired into the city. A
nobleman, named Hynek of Crus̆ina, now undertook
the defence of the city; and when Sigismund again
arrived before it, he found it fortified against him.</p>

<p>Again, the division in his camp between the native
nobles and his Hungarian and German followers
speedily showed itself. Some Moravian barons advised
him to abandon the attack, and frankly owned
that they feared the flails of the rustics. Sigismund,
whose sympathies were becoming more and more
alienated from his countrymen, taunted the Moravians
with cowardice and treachery. They thereupon sprang
from their horses and declared that they were ready
to go where the king would never be. Sigismund
then ordered them to occupy a dangerous and marshy
position on the low land in front of the city, while the
Hungarians were to charge from a higher point. This
double attack was at first successful, for the Utraquists
fled in some confusion. But Hynek rallied their
forces, telling them that the Lord would deliver their
enemies into their hands. He and Nicholaus of Hus
rushed forward gallantly with the others; and once
more the fear of the flails of the rustics caused a panic
among the Catholics. About five hundred of the
Royalists were either killed or wounded, and the rout
was complete. Then the men of Vys̆ehrad consented
to surrender. But though their captors succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
conveying them safely into Prague, they could not
save the church organs and images in the fortress from
being destroyed by the crowd.</p>

<p>The war now raged fiercely on both sides; but
while, in matters of physical cruelty, the Bohemians
were as reckless as their opponents, on two important
points there was a marked difference between the conduct
of the rival armies. In the first place, the stern
morality of the Utraquist leaders prevented any of
those outrages on women in which the Hungarian
soldiers freely indulged; and, secondly, the doctrine
that no faith should be kept with heretics produced
an utter unscrupulousness on the Imperialist side, in
the observance of terms of truce or surrender, which
cannot certainly be alleged, in the same degree, against
the Bohemian leaders.</p>

<p>Yet, in the middle of their desperate struggle for
national existence against German and Hungarian,
the Calixtines and Taborites could not be induced to
suspend their internal quarrels. Z̆iz̆ka, indeed, desired
at first to adopt a more conciliatory policy than was
customary with his colleagues; and he persuaded the
Taborites to act with the citizens of Prague in offering
the crown of Bohemia to the King of Poland. But even
he soon felt compelled to adopt a more aggressive
line of action; for the Calixtines had been so alarmed
at the power of John of Z̆elív, that they had prohibited
the further introduction of novelties in doctrine,
and had deposed those Councillors of the Old
Town who had been elected under the influence of
John. Z̆iz̆ka was so alarmed at these proceedings,
that he abandoned a siege which he was conducting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in a distant part of Bohemia, and marched against
the fortress of R̆íc̆an, which was in the near neighbourhood
of Prague.</p>

<p>This fortress had long been a danger to the citizens;
but they were perfectly well aware that Z̆iz̆ka’s present
motive for marching against it was a desire to control
the deliberations of the Town Councillors. Hynek
of Crus̆ina was so indignant at Z̆iz̆ka’s conduct that
he threw up the captaincy of Prague, and not long
after adopted the cause of Sigismund. Z̆iz̆ka had his
usual good success in the siege; but there is at least
a doubt whether his proceedings were marked by his
usual good faith. The Calixtine leaders had promised
to spare the lives of the defenders of the fortress if
they would surrender; yet, after the surrender was
completed, Z̆iz̆ka burnt alive nine of the priests whom
he found in the garrison. But neither the undoubted
cruelty nor the possible treachery of this proceeding
could prevent Z̆iz̆ka’s victory from producing the
desired effect on the Calixtines; and they now consented
to admit the Taborites to a free discussion of
the points of difference between them and their rivals.</p>

<p>This discussion had at least one advantage. It
showed clearly what was the point which the
Taborites looked upon as the vital difference between
themselves and the Calixtines. For, when the
Masters of the Prague University brought forward
a long list of subjects of controversy, one of the
Taborite leaders complained that they had not come
there to discuss all those points; but that they simply
wished for a decision on the question whether they
should or should not wear special vestments at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
performance of the Mass. Jakaubek of Kladrau consented
to limit the discussion to this one point; and,
although no resolution was arrived at, the Taborites
clearly saw that the majority in Prague were against
them. The fierce spirit of fanaticism, which had
already led the Taborites into such excesses, now
roused them to fury against the Calixtines; and in
one town, at least, they proclaimed that any priest
who was found wearing a special dress at the
celebration of the Mass, should be burned alive in
his vestments.</p>

<p>But this dangerous division between the thinking
and the fighting forces of the Utraquist party was
checked by two events which were both of considerable
importance in the history of the movement. The
first of these was the death of Nicholaus of Hus, who
was thrown from his horse as he was leaving Prague.
This death naturally threw more power into the hands
of Z̆iz̆ka; and he had always felt, much more strongly
than Nicholaus, the necessity of maintaining the
alliance with the Calixtine rulers of Prague. The
other event, which drew the more moderate men of
the two parties together, was the outbreak of a new
division in the ranks of the Taborites themselves.</p>

<p>That a body, with the origin, constitution, and mode
of life which have been already described, should develop
new and unexpected phases of thought, might
have been guessed from the beginning of the movement;
but that the particular doctrine now broached
should have caused division among any section of
the Utraquists must sound very strange to modern
ears. In any revolt against excessive priestly power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
one would have expected that such a doctrine as
Transubstantiation would have been the first to be
attacked. Yet, while both Calixtines and Taborites
were fiercely denouncing the civil power of the clergy,
while they were attacking every outward badge which
seemed to separate the clergy from the laity, they had
yet shrunk with horror from any attack on the doctrine
of Transubstantiation. When, then, Martinek
Hauska, a leading Taborite preacher, began to denounce
this doctrine, he roused the fiercest opposition
among his Taborite colleagues; and two of their
more learned members wrote, in February, 1421, to
Jakaubek of Kladrau and John Pr̆zibram, to consult
them about the best means for opposing this heresy.
The answer to that question was only too easily given;
for, while each party disagreed with every other on
the definition of heresy, there was a striking unanimity
about the right method of dealing with it when defined.
So, while the Calixtines burnt one of the
preachers of the new doctrine in Prague, the
Taborites, doubtless finding them too numerous for
such treatment, forcibly expelled them from Tabor.</p>

<p>Deserted and repudiated by all their neighbours,
these unfortunate exiles wandered about in the woods,
till their destitute condition, acting on their already
excited fancy, drove them into a state of partial insanity.
They plucked off their clothes, and declared
that they would return to the state of innocence.
That men in such a condition would fall into acts of
impurity seems highly probable; but it would surely
be unjust to believe all the rumours circulated against
people who had no opportunity of stating their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
case. The main fact, however, of their living habitually
without clothes seems to be generally admitted;
it was that peculiarity which gained them their name
of Adamites; and it was on that ground that Z̆iz̆ka
seized and burnt fifty of them. They entered the
fire smiling, declaring that they would reign that day
with Christ in heaven.</p>

<p>While these events were weakening the opposition
between the Calixtines and the main body of the
Taborites, other causes were securing still more positive
advantages to the moderate party in Prague. In
April, 1421, Kutna Hora at last fell into the hands of
the joint armies of the Taborites and Calixtines; and
this victory was speedily followed by the capture of
the town of Jaromír. Then C̆enĕk of Wartenberg,
Ulric of Rosenberg, Hynek of Crus̆ina, and other
noblemen who had revolted to Sigismund, came back
to the Utraquist camp. John of Z̆elív seems to have
been the guide and adviser of the Utraquist forces in
this campaign, and he compelled C̆enĕk to make
public confession of his wickedness in having betrayed
the castle of Prague to the king. When this
concession had been made, the nobles returned to
Prague, and regained for a time some of their old
power. That power was strengthened by the speedy
capture of the castle of Prague, which up to this
time had held out against the citizens; and the acceptance
by the nobles of the Four Articles seemed to
complete the reunion of parties.</p>

<p>On July 1, 1421, a great Assembly was held of
nobles, knights, and citizens, at which the question
was discussed whether they should once more recognise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Sigismund as their king. The Moravian nobles
were opposed to his deposition, while the stricter
Utraquists were equally strong against recalling
him; and the Estates at last came to a curious
compromise, which was expressed in the following
words: “That they will not have Sigismund for
their king unless it is the will of God, and unless
the famous Masters of Prague, the Bohemian lords,
the communities of the Taborites, the knights, soldiers,
towns, and other Bohemian communities, give their
consent thereto.”</p>

<p>Then a Council of Representatives from all classes
of the community was chosen to manage the affairs
of State while the throne was vacant. And, if there
had been anything of hesitation and compromise in
the form of their decree, there was no sign of such
feeling in their answer to the envoys whom Sigismund
had sent to assert his claim to the throne. They
drew up a long list of their reasons for rejecting
him as king. The first grounds of complaint were
the deaths of Hus, Jerom, and Krasa, and the
encouragement which Sigismund had given to the
Crusaders against Bohemia. They then dwelt on
his surrender of Brandenburg without the consent of
the Assembly; and they wound up their indictment
by denouncing his rejection of the Four Articles.
Sigismund answered this attack by again repudiating
any sanction on his part to the deaths of Hus and
Jerom; by declaring himself perfectly ready to hear
discussions on the Four Articles; and, finally, by
taunting the Utraquists with their burning of priests
and churches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>But, although a want of confidence in Sigismund
might bind together for a time the various sections of
the Utraquist party; yet, on the other hand, the
intense distrust which the treachery of C̆enĕk and
the other nobles had caused, could not be removed
by this superficial appearance of reconciliation. John
of Z̆elív, though he had admitted the nobles to a
kind of absolution, was foremost in mistrusting the
repentance which had been accompanied with so
much humiliation. A sudden invasion of Bohemia
by the Silesians produced a new cause of distrust;
for the nobles were suspected of having been very
remiss in their resistance of the invaders. This
brought to a head the suspicions which had originally
been grounded on points of doctrinal difference; and
the sterner members of the Utraquist clergy declared
that they had no adequate security for the genuineness
of the conversion of the nobles. John of Z̆elív
followed up this attack by demanding the removal
of all the clergy who adhered to the old ritual,
and who would not sing in Bohemian. The Town
Councils consented to the change, and John succeeded
in thrusting into the vacant preacherships some supporters
even of those doctrines which had been condemned
by both sections of the Utraquist party.</p>

<p>But the fear of foreign invasion was once more to
drive into the background for a time the internal
divisions of the Utraquist party. The fiery energy
of Martin V. had roused the electors of the Empire
from the panic into which they had been thrown by
the failure of the first crusade; and the Margrave of
Meissen, the fiercest of the enemies of Bohemia, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
begun a new invasion on his own responsibility.
Z̆iz̆ka had been recently wounded in his only sound
eye; but, at the rumour of the new attack, he at once
hurried out to battle, and the men of Meissen fled
before him. The rumours of the divisions between
the nobles and the citizens had, however, encouraged
the Meissener to renew their attack; and a few successes
on their part induced Frederick of Hohenzollern
to organise a second crusade among the princes of
the Empire. The Bohemian peasants fled before the
advance of the new army and took refuge in the
town of Z̆atec. So in September, 1421, an army of
two thousand Imperialists marched against Z̆atec, and
the terrified citizens began to despair of resistance.</p>

<p>But their anxieties and dangers came to an
unexpected end. As the watchers were gazing
one day from the city walls on the camp of the
enemy, their attention was caught by a sudden
glow of fire. The flame rapidly spread through
the camp, and all the tents of the enemy were
consumed. To the astonished eyes of the watchers
it seemed as if a miracle had been worked on their
behalf; but the real explanation, though wonderful
enough, was not connected with those interferences
with the order of nature to which conventional
phraseology has confined the name of miracle.
The fact was that the Electors of the German
Empire had heard that the terrible Z̆iz̆ka was
approaching; and so the great army of the second
crusade had burnt their tents and retreated without
striking a blow.</p>

<p class="caption">(<i>From an old picture copied in Dr. Toman’s pamphlet.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>Sigismund had been absent in Hungary during this
struggle, but he now advanced at the head of a
Hungarian army to Brünn (Brno), committing every
kind of barbarity on the way. It will be remembered
that he had recently announced that he had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
objected to a discussion of the Four Articles. He
now summoned all the Moravian nobles before him,
and threatened to put them to death unless they would
abjure all those Articles. Apparently the nobles were
not made of the same stuff as the sturdy preachers of
Tabor and Prague; for, with two exceptions, all the
Utraquist nobles of Moravia consented to abandon
their creed and accept that of Sigismund.</p>

<p>Doubtless encouraged by this success, Sigismund
marched to Kutna Hora at the head of an army of
about eight thousand men. Z̆iz̆ka advanced to the
relief of the town, and the townsmen themselves
made a gallant defence; but some traitor opened
one of the gates to the Imperial soldiers, and the
massacre which followed on their entry made so
deep an impression on the imagination of the
Bohemians, that in later ages it was compared to
the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. Z̆iz̆ka’s forces
were now completely surrounded; and, on the 22nd
of December, 1421, he found himself at the mercy
of his opponents in a bitter winter and without any
possibility of obtaining food. Sigismund now
thought his victory secure; but he little knew with
whom he had to deal. In spite of cold and hunger,
Z̆iz̆ka kept his troops firm and patient till midnight.
Then, having observed the weakest point in
the royal army, he made a sudden and unexpected
dash, broke through the Royalist lines, and was soon
raising new forces and new provisions in the country.
The Hungarians now scattered themselves about,
plundering and ravishing in the neighbouring villages,
when, suddenly, in January, 1422, a party of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
plunderers were startled in an outlying village by the
appearance of Z̆iz̆ka at the head of a new army.
Sigismund was once more panic-struck. He ordered
the town of Kutna Hora to be set on fire; fastened
the councillors to his carriage, and fled as fast as he
could go to the town of Deutschbrod (Nemecky Brod).
Z̆iz̆ka, in spite of the hard frost, followed with all his
horses and baggage-waggons; and he so completely
routed Sigismund that twelve thousand of the Hungarian
army were killed, and the King never again
entered Bohemia during Z̆iz̆ka’s life.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, the divisions in Prague were
reaching their height. John the Priest (as John
of Z̆elív was now called) had, on October 19th, struck
a popular <i>coup d’état</i>. He had persuaded the people
to depose the nobles from office, and to choose one
man as captain of the city, with four others for each
division of the town. The new Councillors, who were
appointed under this arrangement, proceeded to
summon to Prague a certain John Sadlo, who had
been a zealous Utraquist, but who happened to have
incurred the suspicion of the new rulers of the town.
He was promised a safe-conduct; but, on arriving in
Prague, he was seized and summarily executed. The
moderate men of Prague now felt that a stand must
be made; and they called a meeting at which Jakaubek
of Kladrau and Peter Payne drew up certain Articles
for the government of the clergy. Four directors
were to be chosen to regulate the appointment to
every church in Prague, and to prevent the introduction
of novelties in ritual, unless publicly justified
from Scripture. John was urged by his followers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
resist this proposal; but he seems to have felt it better
to give way, and to accept the three colleagues, who
were combined with him in the administration.</p>

<p>But, however much such an arrangement might
satisfy the champions of Utraquist orthodoxy, it
could not restore the sense of order and stability
which had been shaken by John’s overbearing proceedings,
and especially by the murder of Sadlo.
C̆enĕk of Wartenberg and other nobles again fled
to Sigismund; and, although the citizens of Prague
and the Masters of the University were far from being
disposed to that course, they felt that the security
to be obtained by the presence of a King would be
their best guarantee against the encroachments of
the extreme party. The King of Poland had rejected
the offer of the crown; but the Duke of
Lithuania seemed more ready to listen to the advances
of the Bohemians. Apparently, however,
his sympathies arose rather from a general Slavonic
feeling, and a personal dislike of Sigismund, than
from any doctrinal sympathies with the Utraquists.
He had been a comparatively recent convert to
Christianity; and he had all the consequent zeal for
orthodoxy. The Calixtines assured him that they
had no desire for separation from the Romish Church,
and that they did not admit the charge of heresy.
In the hope, therefore, of defeating Sigismund, and
of bringing back the Bohemians to the Catholic
Church, Witold of Lithuania consented that his
nephew, Sigismund Korybut, should be sent to
represent him in Bohemia.</p>

<p>Prince Korybut, however, insisted that, before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
would enter Prague, Priest John should be deposed
from his power. Those nobles who had remained
faithful to the national cause were specially eager
to carry out this understanding. They deposed all
the Councillors both in the Old and New Town; and
they arranged that each quarter should choose new
Councillors for a year, of whom none should be priests
or Masters of Arts. At the same time Has̆ek of
Waldstein was chosen chief captain of the town.
But the terror which John had excited among the
nobles and richer citizens could not be removed by
these arrangements. So on March 8th two councillors
were sent to John, to ask him to come to the
Town Council to consult with them. When he came,
they asked his advice about the plan of campaign,
and seemed to listen respectfully. Then they went
on to urge him to make peace between the rival
parties, before they went to battle. John answered
that, if they desired peace, they must not take away
houses from those to whom the Community had given
them, nor must they depose faithful servants such as
the late Captain of the town. Then, whilst they were
still speaking, the burgomaster gave a sign; and the
soldiers rushed in and seized Priest John and several
of his friends, took them into an outer hall, and
executed them. As soon as the people of the town
heard the news, they rose in fury, broke into the
Council House, seized and beheaded the leading Councillors,
and compelled Has̆ek of Waldstein to fly
for his life.</p>

<p>But it seemed as if the death of John had really
deprived the extreme party in Prague of their chances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of final success; for, when in May, 1422, Korybut
arrived in Prague, he was able, with apparently little
trouble, to remove the Councillors of the extreme
party, and to restore the Calixtines.</p>

<p>For a time Korybut seemed to give new strength
and coherence to the Utraquist movement; but his
reign was not of long duration. Martin V. had been
extremely alarmed at the sympathies shown in Poland
and Lithuania for the Utraquist cause; and by his
orders the Polish clergy persuaded King Ladislaus to
organise a new expedition against the Utraquists,
while they induced Witold of Lithuania to recall
Prince Korybut. But, though the summons for a
third crusade was sent out to Poles, Lithuanians,
Swedes, and Norwegians, yet the Pope soon found
that it was easier to cajole kings than to convert
peoples. Not only did the Poles and Ruthenians
refuse to serve in the crusade; but, in spite of
Ladislaus’s rebukes, they hastened to take up arms
for the Bohemians; and so the third crusade collapsed
even more ignominiously than the former ones.</p>

<p class="caption">OLD PICTURE OF Z̆IZ̆KA IN HEAVEN.</p>

<p class="caption">(<i>From Dr. Toman’s pamphlet.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>The fear of a foreign invasion being thus removed,
the nobles resolved on a final struggle for power with
the Taborites. Z̆iz̆ka had reluctantly consented to
recognise Korybut as king; but the recall of the latter
broke this link between the nobles and the Taborite
leader. He had resented the treacherous murder of
John of Z̆elív; and he had special causes of his own
for distrusting the leading nobles. He himself
belonged to that Order of Knights, or gentry, which
was in continual rivalry with the greater nobility;
while his intense religious zeal, and his scorn of caste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
had drawn him close to the fiery peasants of Mount
Tabor, and increased his contempt for the vacillations
and treacheries of C̆enek of Wartenberg and Ulric of
Rosenberg. The struggle which now followed was
a fierce and bloody one; but it ended in the complete
victory of Z̆iz̆ka, and the consent of the nobles to
return to the popular cause. They were the more
willing to come to terms as the King had just
mortally offended Bohemian feeling by granting
the province of Moravia to Albert, Duke of Austria,
and had recognised him as his heir in Bohemia.
Korybut had now escaped from his uncle and returned
to Bohemia; and, though he was no longer recognised
as their legal ruler, he was welcomed as an ally and
a captain in their wars, and he marched with the
united Utraquist army into Moravia, to deliver it
from Albert of Austria. Z̆iz̆ka, though now completely
blind, also led his forces into Moravia.</p>

<p>But in October, 1424, he was seized with a sudden
illness and died. His death naturally created a great
sensation; and it is a proof of the substantial success
of his work that the changes which were expected to
take place, in consequence of his death, were much
greater than any that actually occurred. A section,
indeed, of his more immediate personal followers did
form themselves into a separate party under the
name of the “Orphans”; but though, like Z̆iz̆ka, they
were more moderate in their doctrines than the rest
of the Taborites, they continued, for all practical purposes,
to act with the latter; nor did Sigismund
find that the terror, which the name of Hussite had
inspired, had at all diminished. A married priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
named Procop rapidly rose to the position which
Z̆iz̆ka had held; and so far was he from slackening
the zeal of his followers that he soon introduced a
more aggressive element into the warfare. Tired of
remaining so long on the defensive, he resolved that
the Germans and Hungarians should feel something
of the misery which they had inflicted on Bohemia;
and he began a series of invasions of Austria, Bavaria,
and Hungary, which considerably added to the terrors
which had been produced by Z̆iz̆ka.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the changes in the Calixtine
party became more noticeable at this time than
among those who seemed more likely to be affected
by Z̆iz̆ka’s death. Jakaubek fell at this time into
the background, and John Pr̆zibram came more to
the front. Pr̆zibram was one of those bitter theologians
who delight to dwell on the negative side of
their doctrines, rather than on those that tend to
unity and positive faith. He had been willing enough
to maintain the cause of the Four Articles of Prague
against the Catholic priests; but, now that the Catholic
cause seemed lost in Prague, he began to express
so offensively and insultingly his opposition to the
Taborites, that he disgusted the more moderate men
of his own party; and on Christmas Day, 1426, he
demanded, in a further discussion, that the Hussites
should specially condemn the doctrines of Wyclif.</p>

<p>This proposal produced a definite change in the
position of Peter Payne. Although his doctrinal
convictions were probably well known, yet, in the
interests of peace and order, he had hitherto been
willing to co-operate with the Calixtines in checking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the excesses of the Taborites. But the attack on his
distinguished countryman, to whose writings he
probably looked for guidance more than to those of
Hus, was too much for his personal and patriotic
sympathies, and he eagerly took up the cause of
Wyclif. The decision of the meeting, however, was
against the English reformer; and Korybut, who
shared his uncle’s dislike to the heretical position into
which the Hussites had been forced, seized upon this
resolution as a sign of their desire to return to union
with the Church. So he sent messengers to Pope
Martin to assure him that this decision represented
the real feeling of the country.</p>

<p>But this unfortunate step, instead of producing
reunion with Rome, only called out new divisions in
the Utraquist party. John Rokycana, the preacher
at the Teyn Church, heard of these negotiations; and,
though a strict and zealous Calixtine, he was a warm
patriot, and by no means disposed to put either his
faith or his nation at the feet of either Emperor or
Pope. So in April, 1427, he preached an alarmist
sermon warning the people that their interests were
being betrayed. The people sprang to arms; Korybut
was imprisoned; and Pr̆zibram and several of his
allies were banished from Prague. But, to prove that
the movement had a national rather than a doctrinal
purpose, Rokycana and his friends passed a resolution
in favour of at least a modified form of Transubstantiation.
Thus Peter Payne was compelled to take his
part with the Taborites, while a new division was
formed among the Calixtines themselves.</p>

<p>But in the meantime the aggressive policy of Procop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
had roused Martin V. to new energy; and since
Germans, Hungarians, and Poles had each in turn
failed him, he entrusted the management of a fourth
crusade to an Englishman. This was the celebrated
Cardinal Beaufort, who was now appointed legate for
Bohemia, Hungary, and Germany, and under whose
auspices a special Hussite tax was raised throughout
the Empire. The Margrave of Brandenburg and the
Archbishop of Trier took the leading part in the
command of the army; and in July, 1427, the new
crusaders entered Bohemia and began the siege of
Kladrau. While they were almost hoping to capture
the town, Procop suddenly advanced against them
at the head of the united Utraquist army. Immediately
the strange panic, which had become traditional
at the approach of the Utraquists, seized upon the
enemy; and they fled to the town of Tachov, which
was at that time in their hands. Here Beaufort met
them, reproached them with their cowardice, and
persuaded them to prepare for battle. But no sooner
did Procop’s army again appear in sight than the
panic once more returned. Beaufort, enraged, seized
the banner of the Empire and tore it to pieces in their
presence. But the sense of fear was too strong, even
for soldierly dignity; and at last the indignant
Cardinal was swept away in the flight. Several new
victories followed, though Pilsen (Plz̆en) still held out
against the Utraquist armies. Beaufort demanded that
a new anti-Hussite tax should be raised, and at the
same time sent a command to the men of Pilsen that
they should abstain from a proposed discussion with
the Hussites on points of doctrine. The discussion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
took place notwithstanding; and Rokycana and Peter
Payne were appointed to represent the Utraquist
party.</p>

<p>The Cardinal might have spared his fears; for the
result of the discussion was to widen the gulf, not
between the Catholics and the Utraquists, but between
the Calixtines and the Taborites. This led to other
discussions between the two Utraquist parties, of so
fierce a kind that it seemed as if their enemies might
almost succeed in profiting by their divisions. But
those enemies were now becoming thoroughly exhausted.
The raids of Procop had brought home to
Germans and Hungarians the danger of provoking
the Bohemians too far; while among many of the
German citizens the question was beginning to be
asked, whether a cause which enabled untrained
peasants to strike terror into the best armies of
Europe was not perhaps the cause of God. Under
these circumstances the cry for a Church Council to
settle these matters by discussion, rather than by force
of arms, was becoming general, and, much as the
Pope loathed such an idea, he found the ground cut
from under his feet by the desertion of his most sturdy
supporter. The war between France and England had
suddenly received a new turn by the appearance of
Joan of Arc; and Cardinal Beaufort’s anxiety for the
success of his country decided him on the desperate
step of employing the money and men whom he had
raised to fight against Bohemia in the war against
France. Alarmed as the Pope and his friends were
at this sudden desertion, they hoped for a time
that the wonderful Maid might herself take up their
cause against the heretics. But when this hope was
cut short by her defeat and imprisonment, the cry for
a Council became again strong, and Martin was even
told that, if he sincerely desired to put down the
Hussites, he would prove it by granting the discussion.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>The fiery Pope, however, was determined to make
one last appeal to arms; and this time he chose an
Italian cardinal, Giuliano Cesarini, to organise a
crusade. Before the crusade could start, Martin V.
died; but Cesarini was as determined as the Pope
had been on leading the expedition to its triumph.
The Margrave of Brandenburg was again appointed
commander, though the suspicions which his previous
flight had caused were so great, that the Cardinal and
the Electors insisted on checking his power by a
Council of Nine. Sigismund declared his approval of
the crusade, and then wrote to Prague to assure the
citizens of his desire for peace.</p>

<p>In the meantime Procop had rallied his forces and
advanced to the borders of Bavaria; but they waited
so long for the enemy that their food began to fail,
and some of the troops dropped off to forage for
supplies. The Germans, encouraged by this laxity,
once more advanced to the town of Tachov. The
Cardinal desired them to storm the town; but the
generals decided to delay the attack; and the townsmen
succeeded in so well fortifying the town that the
German army abandoned the siege, and finally retreated
to Taus (Domaz̆lic̆e). In the meantime the Bohemians
had collected their forces, and on Aug. 14, 1431, they
advanced towards Domaz̆lic̆e, singing one of their
favourite hymns, “Kdoz̆ jste Boz̆i bojovnici”&mdash;“Ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
who are the soldiers of the Lord.” The Cardinal went
up the hill to consult the Duke of Saxony about the
arrangements of the battle, when suddenly he observed
a strange confusion, and heard loud cries in the camp
of the Margrave of Brandenburg. Soon after, Frederick
himself came hastily to him, to tell him that his army
was in full flight and could not be checked. The
panic quickly spread; and this time it was so complete,
that even the waggons and firearms were left
behind; while among the spoil the Bohemians had
the satisfaction of finding, not only the coat and
crucifix of Cardinal Cesarini, but even the Papal Bull
sanctioning the crusade against Bohemia. So ended
the fifth and last attempt to crush out the Hussite
heresy by force; and it was now to be tried whether
the Doctors of the Church could succeed in convincing
the heretics who could not be conquered by the sword.</p>

<h2>XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE OPENING OF THE COUNCIL OF BASEL
TO THE FALL OF TABOR.<br />
(1437-1452.)</span></h2>

<p>The Council of Basel seemed to many to be the
natural result of the Council of Constance. The
conception of a constitutional check on the power of
the Popes, and of a better provision for the orderly
government of the Church, was an idea which had
become familiar to the leading theologians of Europe
during the bitter ecclesiastical divisions of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries. And it must be remembered
that, however unsatisfactory the results
of the Council of Constance may seem to us, the
dignity of its members and the apparent vigour of
its action left a very different impression on the minds
of many of its contemporaries. It had succeeded in
deposing and electing Popes; it had burnt the heretics
whom it had condemned; it had found princes ready
to enforce its decrees by fire and sword. And if
that last exercise of its power had ended in failure
and disgrace, it might be plausibly urged that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
greater part of the war which it had initiated had
been carried on after the dissolution of the Council
itself; and it was held therefore by many that the
summoning of a similar Council would revive an
influence in Europe more capable than the Pope’s of
crushing out heresy and restoring power to the Church.
It was just this consciousness of the popular expectation
from the new Council which strengthened the
opposition of Martin V. to the demand for its convocation.
He may, no doubt, have honestly believed that
his personal initiative was more likely to produce the
desired effect on the crusaders than the necessarily
divided counsels of a large body of princes and clergy.
But at the same time he was very anxious that the
experiment should not be tried of setting up so
dangerous a rival to the Papal authority.</p>

<p>For the time, however, the feeling of the orthodox
world seemed, with few exceptions, to be overwhelmingly
opposed to his; and, even before his death, the
Council of Basel had already begun its deliberations.
But, from an early stage in the preparations for the
Council, a very different conception had been put
forward of the purposes for which it might be used.
The Utraquists had from the first maintained that
they had not had a fair hearing before the Council
of Constance; and their early victories had roused a
hope that some less partial tribunal might give them
that opportunity of discussion of which they had
been defrauded. In the dispute after the battle of
the Z̆iz̆ka Hill, they had had a taste of those delights
of argument for which they hungered; and the later
victories of Z̆iz̆ka had induced Ulric of Rosenberg to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
demand, and Sigismund to promise, that even the
Taborites should have their share in such a discussion.</p>

<p>In 1427 even Frederick of Brandenburg and Cardinal
Beaufort had actually prepared the way for a meeting
which was to afford opportunities for doctrinal discussion;
and, though Pope Martin was able at that
time to prohibit the proposed conference, the Utraquists
did not lose sight of the prospect then held out
to them. But, though this conception of the more
pacific purpose to which a Council might be turned,
naturally induced the Utraquists to listen with some
interest and hope to the arrangements for the meeting
at Basel, that hope was strongly mixed with fear and
suspicion. To them, at least, the memories of Constance
brought nothing but bitterness and loathing;
and the evident hostility of those who were calling
for the Council, led them to doubt whether their
experiences of Basel would be likely to be any
more satisfactory than the unforgotten wrongs of
Constance. But, above all other causes of discontent,
was their ever-deepening distrust of the promises of
Sigismund; and at no time had that distrust been
more fully justified.</p>

<p>New promises for a fair hearing were despatched
by him almost simultaneously with preparations for
a new war; and concessions of the most hopeful kind
were continually explained away. Even the great
overthrow of the last crusade did not bring to an
end the fierce desire of Sigismund to re-establish
his power by force of arms; and the Duke of Bavaria
and the Count Palatine of the Rhine were eager to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
second his efforts in a cause which most men now
recognised as hopeless.</p>

<p>But the growing desire for peace was now increased
by a terrible fear. The rulers of Europe remembered
that desire to throw off the power of their predecessors,
which had shown itself among the peasantry
of Europe after the failure of the crusades in the
thirteenth century; and which had been renewed
after the overthrow of the French nobles by the
English invaders of the fourteenth. This same
feeling was now again apparent; and this time the
hopes which accompanied it were evidently based on
more reasonable grounds. That the Saracen generals
should defeat the armies of Louis IX., or that the
English nobles should overthrow the French at Crecy
and Poictiers, might be convincing arguments of the
weakness of the defeated parties; but they did not
necessarily prove that those who yielded to such
opponents, would succumb to the attacks of an
untrained peasantry. Now, however, for twelve years
past, the peasantry of Bohemia, armed mainly with
their thrashing flails, had repeatedly put to flight the
greatest armies of Europe, and overawed their own
nobility. Surely such an example might give to the
peasants of Germany and France some hope that a
time was coming in which they too might be the
equals of their oppressors! In the South of France
the French peasantry rose in large numbers, demanding
that the nobles should, for the future, be
content to earn their bread by the sweat of their
brow, and declaring that two priests were all that
were required for the spiritual needs of the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
In Dauphiné collections were made on behalf of the
Bohemians; while in the Rhine district three thousand
peasants near Bonn and Speier declared their determination
to overthrow the power of the clergy and
nobles. Under these circumstances, there was a
general cry that, if the Council did not come to
terms with the Hussites, the peasant insurrection
would spread throughout Europe.</p>

<p>Nor, on the other hand, were there wanting strong
reasons why the Bohemians, on their side, should be
eager for a peaceable settlement. On them had fallen
the main misery of the war; and it is a curious fact that,
in spite of their brilliant successes on the battlefield,
much of their country was still in the hands of the
enemy. Not only was the greater part of Moravia
held down by Albert of Austria, but, in Bohemia
itself, the strong fortress of Carlstein, and the important
towns of Budweis (Budejóvice), Pilsen (Plz̆en),
and Eger (Cheb), still held out against the Utraquists.
Moreover, the discontent with the power which Procop
had gained by his victories, was working among the
more moderate section of the Utraquists in favour of
a settlement in which learned men should have more
power than soldiers.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, an understanding was
at last brought about; and, in January, 1433, the
representatives of the Bohemians arrived in Basel.
There seem to have been some five, or possibly six,
Utraquists who had been chosen to represent their
party; but the burden of the discussion, at any rate,
fell upon four people, who were each entrusted with
the defence of one of the Articles of Prague. The
most important of these champions, and the one who
was to gain most credit by the discussion, was, beyond
all question, John Rokycana. He had been steadily
advancing in reputation, both as a learned disputant
and as a moderate and judicious leader. The teacher
from whom he had derived his strongest convictions
was Jakaubek of Kladrau; and he had, as it were, inherited
from him a special devotion to the practice of
Communion in both kinds. Rokycana, like Hus,
had had great struggles with poverty in acquiring his
early education; and, though his doctrines naturally
connected him with the Calixtine section of the
Utraquists, his obscure origin, combined with his
strong will and individuality of character, often
brought him out of sympathy with the aristocratic
patrons of the movement.</p>

<p class="caption">JOHN ROKYCANA.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>His first public action had been an attempt to
make terms between the citizens of Prague and
Z̆iz̆ka, in the last year of Z̆iz̆ka’s struggle with the
nobles, and he induced the latter to abandon an
attack upon the city. His next prominent appearance
had been of a less pacific kind; for it was connected
with his vehement opposition to the attempt
of Prince Korybut to make terms with Sigismund.
Though, however, on that occasion, Rokycana had
been the chief promoter of the arrest of Korybut,
Pr̆zibram, and other champions of compromise; yet
he had steadily exerted himself to prevent bloodshed
in the collision between the two parties; and he had
afterwards encouraged arrangements for the bringing
back of the Calixtine priests who had been expelled
during the struggles. Since the death of Jakaubek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Rokycana seems to have divided the leadership of
the Utraquist clergy of Prague with the Englishman,
Peter Payne.</p>

<p>Payne, as has been already pointed out, belonged,
in doctrine, to the extremer section of the Utraquists;
but by his moderate policy he had often been drawn
into sympathy with the Calixtines. Since the death
of Z̆iz̆ka, he seems to have been frequently identified
with that party of Orphans who claimed to represent,
more exactly than the other Taborites, the policy of
their leader. This choice of colleagues contributed
still further to distinguish Payne from the main body
of those who agreed with his doctrines; and lastly,
the peculiarity of his position was increased by that
reputation for learning which was always an object of
suspicion to the peasant soldiers of Tabor.</p>

<p>The other two Utraquist delegates at the Council
of Basel were entirely representative of the Taborite
party. One was Nicholaus of Pilgram (Pelhr̆imov),
the “Bishop,” as he was called, of the Taborites; and
the other was Procop the Great, the successor of
Z̆iz̆ka on the battlefield. Procop, though less cruel
than Z̆iz̆ka, had a more exclusive faith in physical
force; and he was less interested in questions of
statesmanship, or details of doctrine; but, as the
most successful general in the religious wars, he could
not be passed over in the election of representatives.</p>

<p>On January 4, 1433, the Bohemian delegates
entered Basel, accompanied by a troop of three
hundred horsemen. A great crowd came out to
meet them; and the windows were full of people of
all ages and both sexes, who gazed with astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
on the strange dresses of their visitors; while
those who were determined to assist their eyes by
their imagination, discovered that these terrible
heretics had repulsive faces and cruel eyes. To
most of the spectators the chief object of interest
was the famous general, Procop; and all strained
their eyes to get a glimpse of the man whose very
name had become so great a terror to the armies of
the Empire.</p>

<p>Foremost among those who hastened to welcome
the strangers was Cardinal Julian Cesarini; and it
must be owned that few men ever had a more
difficult part to play, or played it with more consummate
tact and success. It required some courage
to claim the position of impartial arbitrator, where
one of the parties to the cause was a body of men
against whom he had recently proclaimed a destructive
crusade; nor could it be altogether gratifying to
him to face in discussion men who had won their
right to a hearing by putting him to an ignominious
flight. Added to these considerations, was the further
difficulty that, while he heartily desired the success
of the Council, he took part in its proceedings as the
representative of a Pope who had denounced it, and
who wished to dissolve it. But the Cardinal was
unusually well supplied with that graceful tact and
ready wit which so distinguishes his countrymen.
He resigned the formal presidency of the Council in
deference to the Pope’s opposition; yet he not only
remained in the city, but even managed by timely
interventions to gain as much control over the proceedings
of the Council as if he were still its official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
chief. With regard to the Bohemian delegates, he
evidently set before himself, from the first, two
objects, both of which he, in some measure, accomplished.
He was determined that the Council should
pass off peaceably, and that the Bohemians should
have no cause to complain that they had failed to
obtain a fair hearing; but he was equally resolved
that, if concessions should be made to the heretics,
those concessions should be, indirectly, a means of
weakening the Utraquist cause. With the keen eye
of a diplomatist, he at once noted the points of
division between his opponents, and the best means
of making use of them. Friendly as was his bearing
towards all the representatives of the Bohemians, the
one whom he singled out for peculiar attention
and flattery was Procop; and the determination
which he showed to bring him and his friends to the
front betrays a purpose which it is not difficult to
understand.</p>

<p>On January 10, 1433, the Council gathered in the
Dominican cloister at Basel, to receive their new
guests. To most of the orthodox Councillors it must
have seemed a most humiliating moment when those,
whom they had hoped to exterminate as heretics,
were admitted to argue on equal terms, in defence of
the orthodoxy of their doctrines. But Cesarini was
equal to the occasion; he welcomed the Bohemians
as at last returning to the bosom of their mother
Church; and, while promising them a fair hearing,
managed to emphasise the principle that the authority
of Councils and of Fathers of the Church must be
accepted as guides in the settlement of points of faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>Rokycana answered by admitting that the Councils
and Fathers would have their due weight with his
friends; but he maintained, at the same time, that
the Council of Constance had condemned their
doctrines without a hearing. On their part, they
were prepared to confirm all their doctrines by
reference to the Gospels and the other sacred writings;
they came to prove their innocence in the
presence of the whole Church; and they asked that
they should have a fair hearing before laymen as
well as clergymen. The Utraquists were then asked
what points they wished to discuss in which they
differed from the practice of the Romish Church. They
answered by enumerating the Four Prague Articles.</p>

<p>Cesarini now saw his opportunity, and he at once
asked the Utraquist representatives if there were not
other doctrines which had been specially put forth by
them; for instance, he had heard it said that they
believed the Mendicant Orders to have been founded
by the devil. Procop immediately sprang up, and
exclaimed that that was perfectly true; for, since
these Orders were not founded by Moses, the Patriarchs,
or the Prophets, nor yet by Christ, they must
have been founded by the devil. This extraordinary
argument was naturally received with laughter in the
Council; but Cesarini insisted on treating it as
serious, and met it by an elaborate refutation.</p>

<p>On the 16th of January, Rokycana opened his
speech in defence of the granting of the Cup to the
laity. While grounding his argument largely on the
custom of the primitive Church, he yet fortified it by
reference to decisions of Councils; and he asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
whether any Council, before that of Constance, had
ever condemned the practice as heretical.</p>

<p>His speech produced a deep impression, even on
his opponents; but the effect was somewhat weakened
when, a few days later, Nicholaus, the Bishop of
Pilgram (Pelhr̆imov), opened the discussion on the
second Prague Article, namely, the punishment by
the Church of offences against morality. He quickly
passed into attacks on the priesthood for the neglect
of their duties, and became so fierce that he caused
a disturbance in the Assembly; so that Rokycana
afterwards rebuked his colleague for his intemperate
language.</p>

<p>A less prominent delegate, Oldr̆ich of Znojem,
was entrusted with the defence of the doctrine of
the free preaching of the Word; and the Fourth
Article, on the civil dominion of the clergy, was
treated by Peter Payne. Payne had always impressed
his opponents with the subtlety of his arguments;
but he must somewhat have embarrassed his
colleagues by a defence of the doctrines of Wyclif;
and, particularly by that claim of the English Reformer
that the temporal lords might, in some
circumstances, take away the property of the clergy.
It was, however, among his own countrymen that
Payne’s appearance excited the most irritation; and
several of them sprang up to attack him, not only as
a condemned heretic, but as a traitor to King Henry
VI. The hubbub at last became so great that he
was forced to end his argument by handing in a
written paper. Then followed the champions of
orthodoxy; and very bitter was the feeling provoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
by the attacks of John of Ragusa upon the Bohemian
nation, as a whole. Cesarini exerted himself to
restore order; but he again insisted that the Bohemians
should express their opinions, not only on the
Four Articles of Prague, but on the Twenty-four
Articles of the Taborites, which involved a modified
denial of Transubstantiation, and the rejection of
many doctrines and rites accepted by the main body
of the Utraquists.</p>

<p>The division of opinion, called out by this demand
of the Cardinal, tended to weaken the order and
decorum of the proceedings, and yet further increased
the disturbance; and the orthodox critics of the
debates began to demand how it was that the Council
had failed as yet to convert the heretics, and to
suggest that it would be better to resort to the former
method of the sword. The delegates themselves
gradually grew tired of the discussion, and desired
to return to Bohemia. Even those Councillors who
were most anxious for the success of the Council
felt that the bitterness, which had arisen, prevented
the hope of any useful conclusion in Basel; so, by
way of compromise, it was at last decided that
Rokycana and his colleagues should return to
Prague; but that delegates from the Council should
be sent to continue the conference in that city.
Thus ended the first stage of the discussion; and,
while Rokycana returned to influence affairs in the
capital, Procop hastened back to renew the often-attempted
siege of Pilsen.</p>

<p>It now became clear that the divisions, which had
been so carefully fostered between the Calixtines and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the Taborites, were ready to break out into a dangerous
flame. On the one hand, Meinhard of Neuhaus,
one of the few nobles who had remained partially
faithful to the Utraquist cause, called together a
meeting of his supporters, and urged them to shake
off the yoke of Procop, and to choose a captain from
the ranks of the poorer nobility, who should carry on
the government with the help of a Council. On the
other hand, Lupus, a priest of the Taborites, stirred
up the inhabitants of the New Town against Rokycana
and his friends, and exhorted them to refuse
submission to the newly-elected Captain. Nor did
the arrival of the ambassadors from Basel tend to
lessen this bitterness; for though they held out hopes
of concessions to the Calixtines, they fanned the
flame of division between them and the Taborites;
and, about the time of their return to Basel, friendly
messengers came to Pilsen to urge the Catholics to
stand firm, as their victory was approaching.</p>

<p>Indeed, so successfully had the work of division
been done, that the ambassadors had found the means
of discrediting Rokycana himself with many of the
Calixtines, and of bringing to the front the old party
of Pr̆zibram, which had been out of favour ever since
the time of Prince Korybut. The wedge which they
used to make this split was sufficiently ingenious.
They proposed that the Communion in both kinds
should be allowed to those who wished it; but that
the Communion in one kind should be left, in those
churches where it was preferred. To modern thinkers,
no doubt, such a compromise would seem the ideal
settlement; but to those who had been struggling, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
so many years, against the invaders who were trying
to crush out these practices, it seemed as if such a
concession would only sow the seeds of fresh bitterness.
Such a compromise, said Rokycana, Wenceslaus
IV. had attempted; and the attempt had ended
in a bitter fight, in which one party had expelled the
other. There was much force in Rokycana’s arguments;
but it was easy to represent him as an opponent
of reasonable liberty, and (a charge which was
more telling at that moment) as a hinderer of peaceable
union.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, the siege of Pilsen was
making such progress that the Catholics and moderate
Utraquists began to fear that the victory, which
seemed almost within their grasp, might be taken
from them after all; and Sigismund wrote to Ulric of
Rosenberg that the Taborites were actually preparing
to send a special embassy of their own to Basel;
and that, unless the Calixtines would go to Pilsen, to
hinder the progress of Procop, the Council of Basel
would after all be compelled to make concessions to
the extreme party. While things were in this state,
Procop suddenly received news in his camp that the
bitterness between the two parties in Prague had at
last led to a final outbreak. The Taborites of the
New Town had resolved to resist the authority of the
newly elected Captain, and had fortified their division
of Prague against him; whereupon Meinhard of
Neuhaus had suddenly stormed the New Town and
put the Taborites to the sword. Thereupon Procop
at once resolved to abandon the siege of Pilsen, and
to call on all the Taborites to follow him to Prague.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Meinhard rallied his forces for the defence; and the
two armies met on the 30th of May, 1434, near the
town of Lipaný.</p>

<p>The Taborites followed the plan, so often adopted
by Z̆iz̆ka, of fortifying their camp by an arrangement
of their baggage waggons. From behind these they
threw shells into the camp of the enemy, which so irritated
the soldiers that they called on the nobles to
lead them to the attack. The nobles, however, were
resolved to accomplish their purposes by stratagem.
The inferior troops were placed in the front, with
orders to give way at the first attack. The Taborites
fell into that trap; and, seeing the enemy, as they
supposed, flying before them, they left their entrenchments
and pursued them. The picked troops of the
nobles then rushed forward, seized on the deserted
waggons, and attacked the Taborites in the rear. The
supposed fugitives, at the same time, turned upon
their pursuers; the Taborite army, surrounded on
all sides, was cut to pieces; and Procop and the
other leaders died, fighting to the last.</p>

<p>The immediate results of the battle of Lipaný
were of two kinds. One of the chief objects of
Meinhard of Neuhaus and his friends had been to
pave the way for negotiations with Sigismund, and
this object they at once obtained; but the conduct of
the negotiations was not altogether left to those who
had been the chief promoters of division. The death
of Procop and of his immediate followers had given
an opportunity to the more moderate party of the
Orphans to come to the front; and, as C̆apek, the
leading general of the Orphans, was now the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
prominent military leader among the advanced section
of the Utraquists, the change naturally led to a
removal of many of the differences which had so
weakened the common cause. C̆apek carried on the
policy of Z̆iz̆ka in the matter of maintaining an
alliance with those of the Calixtines who were
sincerely zealous for their country and their faith.</p>

<p>The man who most embodied that cause, in the
eyes of the general body of Bohemian patriots, was
undoubtedly Rokycana; and thus he found that his
position had been greatly strengthened, for the time,
by the apparent victory of his opponents. While,
therefore, the leaders of the Assembly were able to
organise a deputation to Sigismund, of which Meinhard
of Neuhaus was the chief leader, the terms
which the deputation offered were considerably
coloured by the feeling of Rokycana and his friends;
for, on the one hand, they decided to insist on many
doctrines and rites which were condemned by the
Taborites; and on the other hand, they demanded a
strict enforcement of the Four Articles. They even
proposed that no one should be received into the city
who did not communicate in both kinds; that the king
should admit no one into his Councils who did not
observe the same rule; and that, if any community was
oppressed by the Emperor or his officials on account
of Utraquism, they should have the right of meeting
force by force. It was impossible to suppose that
Sigismund would accept terms of this kind, in so
crude a form; but his growing eagerness to recover
his crown made him extremely willing to enter into
the discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>He would, indeed, have been glad to base his claim
on grounds independent of the religious controversy;
and he even ventured to appeal to the Bohemians to
accept him out of respect to his father’s memory, and
to remember that his grandmother was a Bohemian
princess, descended from the old ploughman king,
Pr̆emysl. At the same time he remonstrated so
sharply with the delegates of Basel on the slowness
of their proceedings, and the quibbling of their arguments,
that they began to fear that he would drift
away into complete opposition to the Council. They,
therefore, urged on both parties the acceptance of an
understanding which had been already put into shape
in Basel. This compromise involved the acceptance
of the Four Articles, under certain conditions; the
most important of which were that the Communion
in both kinds should only be allowed to those who
admitted the complete presence of Christ in the Sacrament;
and that, with regard to the punishment of
public sins, the clergy should only be permitted to
deal with the offences of their own Order.</p>

<p>But Rokycana complained that these and other
modifications required further explanation; and, on
the other hand, the Basel delegates were alarmed at
a proposal put forward by their opponents that no
Bohemian should be summoned before any foreign
tribunal, whether secular or spiritual.</p>

<p>All difficulties, however, gave way before Sigismund’s
inexhaustible power of lying; for, when the
delegates found that his promises and concessions
had no real meaning, they began to calculate that,
if he were restored, he must rely mainly on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Catholics and the Pr̆zibram party, and therefore would
find his interest in breaking his word to the Utraquists,
and maintaining it towards the Catholics. But,
perhaps, neither Sigismund nor the delegates of Basel
were quite prepared for the result of one concession
which the King was induced to make. The Archbishop
and two suffragan bishops were, according to the proposals
of the Assembly, to be elected by representatives
of all classes. A Council of Sixteen was chosen for
this purpose; and they secretly fixed upon Rokycana
as Archbishop of Prague. As soon as this election
became known, the Emperor and the representatives
of Basel were deeply offended at their choice; but
Sigismund, as usual, succeeded in evading a direct
reply; and, in their zeal for union, the Bohemians
consented, for a moment, to overlook this evasion. So
on the 14th of August, 1436, Sigismund was once
again formally accepted as king by the representatives
of all classes, the three towns of Königgrätz
(Sadova), Mies (Kladrau), and Kolin alone refusing
to admit his claim.</p>

<p>It soon became evident that the King’s acceptance
of the Compacts of Basel, and of all the limitations of
his power, had been nominal. He speedily dismissed
from office the most zealous Calixtines, and
encouraged the growth of Catholic ritual. With
regard to Rokycana, the King again found a means
of evading any direct action. Philibert, Bishop of
Coutances, had come to Prague as one of the representatives
of the Council of Basel; and, in consideration
of his rank and position, he was allowed to
perform the duties which should have been entrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
to the Archbishop of Prague. At the same time the
King made a formal appeal to the Council of Basel
to confirm Rokycana’s election; but he advised them
secretly to find excuses for delay in answering this
appeal.</p>

<p>Rokycana was not the man to conciliate a prince
like Sigismund. He observed with alarm the disreputable
courtiers who had gathered round the King;
and he soon began to denounce the gambling, profligacy,
and drunkenness which were beginning to
reappear in the city. It will be remembered that
Rokycana had, from the first, prophesied an evil
result from the compromise with the Council of
Basel; and he now experienced the truth of his own
prediction. Mutual recriminations were exchanged between
Philibert and himself; each charging the other
with violating the Compacts, and enforcing their special
form of ritual in a manner contrary to the agreement.</p>

<p>The Praguer soon showed their indignation at
the treatment which their elected Archbishop had
received; and they indignantly demanded that their
nomination should be accepted. Sigismund, however,
was now being drawn by his supporters into a complete
Catholic reaction. Monasteries and friaries
were restored; and ecclesiastical property, which had
passed into other hands, was re-demanded. This was
a violation, in spirit at least, of the understanding on
which Sigismund had been allowed to return. Rokycana’s
denunciations grew fiercer than before; and
Sigismund answered them by threats which induced
the preacher to believe that his life was in danger; so
he at last sought safety in flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>If Sigismund had behaved treacherously and
violently towards the leaders of the Calixtines, he was
equally faithless in his dealings with the Taborites.
The determined opposition which they had offered to
him on his first return to the kingdom, had compelled
him to make concessions in order to secure their
allegiance; and he had promised that they should
be allowed the use of their own ritual, for six years,
without any disturbance; and that they should also
be permitted to choose six Councillors for the government
of their town. Doubtless the King had at
once looked forward to an opportunity for breaking
these promises; but, when they first returned to
Prague, it seemed possible to weaken the Taborites
by the milder process of stirring up division between
them. Soon after the battle of Lipaný, Rokycana
had submitted to Peter Payne the question whether
Wyclif and Hus had ever held the Taborite doctrines
on the seven sacraments and the invocation of saints,
and other subjects of dispute. Payne delayed his
answers to these questions; and Sigismund found the
matter still unsettled on his arrival. He, therefore,
peremptorily demanded that the required opinion
should at once be given. Payne, thereupon, candidly
replied that he could not discover any evidence of the
acceptance of these Taborite doctrines by Wyclif or
Hus; but that, nevertheless, he (Peter Payne) was
prepared to support those doctrines. The answer
was a dangerous one; for, while it emphasised the
difference between Payne and the Calixtines, it
provoked a fierce denunciation from the Taborite
Bishop of Pilgram (Pelhr̆imov), who was indignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
that his party should be deprived of the protection of
two such honoured names. But, though Sigismund
might have found it more natural to accomplish the
fall of his enemies by sowing division among them,
Bishop Philibert, and his colleagues from Basel, required
more peremptory measures. So Sigismund
once more broke his promises, and threatened to
trample out the Taborites with fire and sword.</p>

<p>These repeated acts of duplicity naturally alienated
from him many of those who had at first been disposed
to support him; and when a man named John Rohac
set up a fortress on Mount Sion and denounced the
King and his policy, the Assembly of Bohemia actually
refused to vote funds for suppressing the insurgents;
and they told the King that he might march against
Rohac at his own cost. Rohac, indeed, was suppressed
after a short struggle; but his example was imitated
by many nobles and citizens; and Sigismund at last
left Prague in disgust and disappointment and retired
into Moravia. He seems to have had some intention
of again betaking himself to Basel, partly to hinder
the growing quarrel between the Pope and the Council,
partly, no doubt, to secure the help of both against
his rebellious subjects. But, on his way through
Moravia, he was taken ill, and on the 9th of December,
1437, he died at Znojem.</p>

<p>The power which he had gained by his re-conquest
of Bohemia, and the fierce hatred which he had excited
by his whole career, were alike manifested by the
events which immediately followed his death. The
champions of Sigismund at once proposed that his son-in-law,
Albert of Austria, should be chosen king. This,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
they said, had been Sigismund’s dying wish; and they
backed Albert’s claim, not only by reference to his
marriage with Sigismund’s daughter, but by the old
promise of Charles IV., that the House of Austria
should succeed the House of Luxemburg on the
throne of Bohemia. But, on the other hand, the
House of Hapsburg had always been looked upon
as enemies by all the most patriotic Bohemians, and
there were at least three reasons why Albert himself
should be specially unpopular in the country. He
had tried to use the power which Sigismund had entrusted
to him, to drag away Moravia from its connection
with Bohemia. He had desired to Germanise
all the cities that fell into his hands; and he had taken
an active part in the war against the Utraquists.
Although, therefore, the champions of Albert succeeded
in obtaining a majority in his favour in the
Bohemian Assembly, Rokycana and his followers
were able to rally round them some of the most
active spirits of the nobles and many of the knights
and citizens, and to secure the election, at Tabor, of
Ladislaus, King of Poland.</p>

<p>Ladislaus was chosen on the ground that, if they
could not get a Bohemian prince, the Bohemians
should at least secure a king from a nation allied to
them in language and race. This King accepted the
crown on behalf of his younger brother, Casimir; and
a war followed which might have been somewhat uncertain
in its results, but that Albert, who had also been
chosen King of Hungary, was compelled to hasten to
that country to resist the invasion of the Turks. There,
too, he found opposition, on the ground of his strong
German feeling; many of the Hungarian nobles were
disposed to revolt from him; and, worn out with
anxiety and illness, he retired to Vienna, and died
there, less than two years after his election.</p>

<p class="caption">ZNAYM (ZNOJEM), SCENE OF SIGISMUND’S DEATH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>His death at once produced a change in the feeling
of Bohemian parties. His widow, Elizabeth, might
have been unfortunate in her marriage with a German,
and not much more fortunate in being the daughter
of Sigismund; but she was, none the less, the granddaughter
of Charles IV., and, through the mother
of Charles, the most direct descendant of the old
Bohemian line. The sentiment which naturally
gathers round a widowed queen seems always to
have exercised an important influence in Bohemian
history, and all parties agreed to suspend their strife
until the expected heir should be born. But no
sooner was it known that the queen had been
delivered of a son than the question at once arose
of who was to be his guardian. The new Emperor,
Frederick III., at last consented to accept this office;
and, both as Emperor and head of the House of
Austria, he was considered the rightful protector of
the young Ladislaus.</p>

<p>But it was evident that neither party desired that
Bohemia should be at the mercy of the Emperor of
Germany, and it was therefore necessary to choose
two Councillors to govern the kingdom during Ladislaus’
minority. Ulric of Rosenberg, who had now
become the leader of the Catholic party, decided to
hold aloof, for a time, from politics; and, consequently,
Meinhard of Neuhaus, who had represented
the ultra-moderate party of the Utraquists, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
chosen as the best protector of the Catholic interests
in the Council, while a nobleman named Ptac̆ek
represented the party of Rokycana.</p>

<p>The disorder which naturally arose in a country
divided by factions, and without a recognised king,
was further increased by the revival of those theological
disputes, which had fallen, for a time, into the
background. The Taborites, whom their enemies
had, no doubt, supposed to have been crushed at
the battle of Lipaný, had proved themselves a still
vigorous force in the struggle against Albert; and
Ptac̆ek became extremely jealous of their power,
and desired to suppress them. A quarrel between
one of the leading Taborites and some of the
Silesians led to a Silesian invasion of Bohemia, and
gave Ptac̆ek an excuse for demanding the suppression
of the Taborite League. Rokycana for the moment
intervened to make peace among the parties, and
attempted to secure a free discussion of points of
difference. At first the Taborites were unwilling to
come to these discussions, declaring that they were
afraid of Ptac̆ek’s tyranny, and appealing to Sigismund’s
former promise that they should not be compelled
to change their ritual; but at last, after actual
violence had been resorted to, and the Taborite town
of Vodnian had been taken by storm, both parties
consented to a meeting at Kutna Hora for a final
discussion of the points at issue. Two presidents were
chosen for the conference, Wenceslaus of Drachov, as
representing the Calixtines, and Peter Payne, as the
champion of the Taborites.</p>

<p>Payne had recently called out an unexpected burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
of enthusiasm among his Bohemian friends. Returning,
apparently, from a visit to Basel, he had been
seized at Nürnberg by a nobleman named Burian von
Gutenstein, and held as a prisoner. Burian offered
to surrender him to Henry VI. of England; but
Henry feared that he might be intercepted and
rescued at Basel. That Council was now openly
at war with Eugenius IV.; and, while the Pope was
summoning an opposition Council at Ferrara, the
Baseler, on their side, had declared Eugenius deposed,
and had set up an anti-pope of their own.
Many of those who had most earnestly wished for
the meeting of the Council were now withdrawing
their support from it; and Henry VI., who had been
one of the first to urge its convocation, now denounced
and feared it. He, therefore, advised Burian to send
his prisoner direct to the Pope at Ferrara or Florence.
This Burian was willing enough to do; but Eugenius
was occupied with his contest with the Council of
Basel, and with his attempt to help the Greeks against
the Turks; and he found it difficult to deal properly
with his proposed prisoner. Under these circumstances
the Taborite towns cut the knot by offering
to raise a large ransom for Payne. This was accepted
by Eugenius, and Payne was restored to the Taborites
amid great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Thus, in spite of his foreign origin and of
the offence which he had given by his recent
decision, Payne was readily accepted by the
Taborites as their spokesman at this, their final
appearance as controversialists. Nay, so ready were
they to abandon, in his favour, some of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
strongest feelings, that they actually rebuked Pr̆zibram
for disputing with Payne in the Bohemian
language, since the Englishman was unable to understand
it. The questions in dispute seem mainly to
have turned upon the nature of the presence of Christ
in the Sacrament; and the controversy grew so hot
that Koranda, the Taborite priest, made the same
challenge to Pr̆zibram which Hus had formerly made
to the Masters who wished to condemn Wyclif;
namely, that, if convicted, he would be willing to be
burnt as a heretic, provided that his opponents
would consent to the same punishment in case of
conviction. Finally, the discussion was referred to
the next Assembly of the Estates of Bohemia, an
Assembly which, under Ptac̆ek’s influence, readily
decided in favour of the Calixtines, as against the
Taborites.</p>

<p>Ulric of Rosenberg, who had previously held aloof
from the discussions of the Assembly, now saw his
opportunity in the division of his enemies; and he
hoped to use the Calixtines as allies in crushing out
their more formidable opponents. But, while this
scheme was still in a state of preparation, Ptac̆ek
died, and the discussion of the Utraquists was temporarily
brought to an end by the rise of a new
leader.</p>

<p>This leader was a young man of twenty-four named
George of Podĕbrad. His father had been a friend
and protector of Z̆iz̆ka; and his family had been more
steadily identified with the Utraquist cause than most
of the nobles of Bohemia. He was the godson of
Z̆iz̆ka, had distinguished himself in the war between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Ladislaus and Albert, and had since been made the
captain of the Bunzlau (Boleslav) Circle, a specially
Protestant district. He seems to have had a singular
gift of inspiring confidence, and a diplomatic power
of seizing opportunities. Although he defended the
claims of Rokycana to the archbishopric, the Taborites
were at first as zealous as the Calixtines in welcoming
him as a leader; and he adroitly contrived to bring
to the front once more that proposal for the recognition
of the Compacts of Basel, which appeared to be
a bond between the different sections of the Utraquists.
Nor was it to the Utraquists alone that he
at first appealed for support; for his demand that
the Emperor should surrender Ladislaus to the
Bohemians attracted the sympathies of the more
patriotic Catholics. By his help negotiations were
opened with Emperor and Pope; and the death of
Eugenius IV. seemed to open a new chance for the
concession by the Papacy of some of the Utraquist
demands. But, though Pope Nicholaus might be
willing, for a time, to use friendly words, the Emperor
Frederick was more uncompromising, and he absolutely
refused to restore the young king to the
Bohemians.</p>

<p>George of Podĕbrad now decided to make himself
more completely master of the situation; and a quarrel
which had recently broken out between the Bohemians
and Duke William of Saxony gave him an excuse
for raising a large force of soldiers. His work was
soon simplified by the action of his opponents. Cardinal
Carvajal, coming to Prague to negotiate about
the demands of the Bohemians, expressed a desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
see a copy of the actual Compacts of Basel; and, on
getting it into his hands, he tried to carry it away
from the city. Several of the Utraquist leaders
followed him, and forced him to surrender the document;
but this attempt finally destroyed any hope
which the Utraquists might have cherished of a compromise
with the Catholics. The sincere Utraquists
at once drew together; while Meinhard of Neuhaus
openly took the Catholic side. The excitement in
Prague became intense, and George of Podĕbrad
seized the moment to march to the city. After a
short pretence of negotiation, he suddenly attacked
the town on the 3rd of September, 1448, and captured
it by assault. Rokycana was welcomed back
in triumph, and Meinhard of Neuhaus was thrown
into prison, where he soon after died.</p>

<p>Although George had acted as the champion of
the Utraquists in their struggle against Albert and
Neuhaus, his first object in seizing the power into
his hands was to restore order in the country. For
that purpose, he wished to conciliate the Catholics,
as much as the Utraquists; and he brought into
office Zdenek of Sternberg, one of the fiercest of
the Catholic party. He even succeeded in gradually
drawing the Rosenbergs to his side; though, at the
same time, he always treated Rokycana as his chief
adviser, and was urgent for his recognition as archbishop.
This policy was extremely resented by the
Taborites, and they were ready to combine, even
with the discontented Catholics, against him.</p>

<p>When, then, in 1452, George was at last chosen
Administrator of the kingdom, he found opposition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
his authority, not only in the extreme Roman Catholic
centres of Budweis (Budejóvice) and Pilsen (Plz̆en), but
also in Tabor, and other Taborite towns. George, however,
had now risen to the position of a national leader,
accepted by all those who preferred the order and unity
of Bohemia to the triumph of any particular party.
Rokycana, on his side, had gained an influence
among the Utraquists, as a whole, which made the
resistance of any section of them far less formidable
than it had been in former days. Moreover, the
chief interest of the country was, for the moment,
centred rather in the recovery of their king than in
the decision of any theological doctrine; and, in their
desire to rescue Ladislaus from Frederick, the Bohemians
received the sympathy of the Hungarians,
and even of the Austrians.</p>

<p>This discontent with Frederick led to actual preparations
for war on the part of the three nations
aggrieved by his action; and George, in his capacity
of Governor of Bohemia, had an excuse for raising
forces without at once declaring the purpose for
which they were to be used. When, however, his
preparations were complete, in August, 1452, he
suddenly marched against Tabor. At first the
Taborite priests were disposed to rouse the citizens
to their usual attitude of determined resistance; but,
as soon as George appeared before the town, the old
unconquerable spirit vanished; the citizens were
seized with a panic, and consented to recognise George
as Governor. Still, it might have seemed as if this
recognition was to be merely a part of a compromise,
according to which the rights and liberties of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Taborites were still to be recognised; but when, in
pursuance of this belief, they sent their Bishop Nicholaus
and their favourite priest, Koranda, to Prague,
to discuss their points of difference with the Calixtines,
Nicholaus and Koranda were suddenly seized
and imprisoned, until they would consent to yield to
Rokycana’s authority. Even this did not kindle the
old spirit of the Taborites; and, in December, 1452,
the Calixtine priests entered Tabor, and celebrated
Mass with those rites and ornaments which the
Taborites had fought so hard to suppress.</p>

<p>The fall of Tabor marks a great crisis in the Utraquist
movement; and though there is another phase
of that movement which has yet to be recorded, the
distinctive character, that had given it such life and
force, must evidently have been doomed to destruction
before such an event could have occurred. Important
as was the element contributed to the Utraquist
cause by the learned scholars of the University of
Prague, they could never have produced so vivid an
effect on Europe had they not been backed by the
fiery enthusiasm, the high ideals, and the ferociously
combative spirit of the flail-bearing peasants of Tabor.
It was the flails of the Taborites which made the
Moravian nobles flinch from the battle of Vys̆ehrad;
it was they who had scared every army which came
against them, from the time of the first battle of the
Z̆iz̆ka Hill to the day when Cardinal Cesarini fled in
panic from the country which he had been so certain
of conquering. The zeal of the Taborites for purity and
simplicity of life had supplied an impulse which no
theological doctrine could of itself contribute; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
their intolerance of priestly forms, and their belief in
the superiority of the Congregation of the Faithful
to the decrees of any learned society, had given that
democratic colouring to the movement which has
made their traditions such a lasting force in Bohemia,
even to the present day. At the same time their
turbulent savagery and fierce intolerance made it
necessary that, at some time or other, they should be
absorbed in a broader and more orderly organisation.
The Independents had now found their Cromwell;
and to him they were obliged to sacrifice much of the
liberties for which they had originally fought.</p>

<h2>XII.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE FALL OF TABOR TO THE DEATH OF
GEORGE OF PODĔBRAD.<br />
(1452-1470.)</span></h2>

<p>The parallel suggested at the end of the last
chapter between Cromwell and George of Podĕbrad
must, like all such parallels, be taken with very considerable
modifications; and it was perhaps not one
of the least points of difference between these two
rulers that George’s first object, after the establishment
of his power, was to bring back the King, who
was still detained by the Emperor of Germany. As
a concession to one of the complaining nations, and
very likely with the hope of exciting jealousy between
them, Frederick had brought the young Ladislaus to
Vienna; but, if this step conciliated the Austrians,
it does not appear to have excited any opposition on
their part to the return of Ladislaus to Bohemia.
Nor were the Catholic nobles able to make use of his
restoration for weakening the power of George; they
could not even prevent the Utraquists of the Assembly
from resolving that Ladislaus should be asked, before
his coronation, to accept the Compacts of Basel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>The feelings of the boy king were evidently somewhat
painfully divided. The education which Frederick had
given him had produced in him a great zeal for the
Catholic cause; but the zeal was modified, and somewhat
counteracted, by his deeply rooted conviction
that it was to George of Podĕbrad alone that he
owed the possibility of becoming King of Bohemia.
Both these feelings were made manifest on his arrival
in Prague. When Rokycana came out at the head
of the clergy to welcome the young king, Ladislaus
turned away and would hardly notice the Archbishop,
until George induced him to thank Rokycana for his
address. But, when the procession reached the
Catholic College, the king sprang from his horse and
did special reverence to those clergy who had been
restored to their livings on the occasion of Sigismund’s
coronation. The struggle between Ladislaus and his
strong-willed viceroy was of short duration. George
was resolved not to yield on the question of Rokycana’s
position; and the young king left Prague in
great indignation. He did not, indeed, at once
abandon his efforts for effecting a reconciliation between
the Pope and the Bohemians, at the expense
of the popular Archbishop; but, on his second visit to
Prague in 1457, he found both George and Rokycana
still obstinate in their resistance; and the poor boy’s
efforts at the settlement of the difficulties of the
Church were cut short by illness and death. On his
deathbed he again renewed to George his admission
that he owed the crown to his influence; and he
entreated him to govern the dependent provinces
justly, and to secure that those, who had followed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
young King from Austria to Bohemia, should be
allowed to return peaceably to their own country.</p>

<p>The death of Ladislaus extinguished the last claim
to direct descent from the old Bohemian kings; and
the consequence was that a larger number of candidates
than usual came forward to claim the Bohemian
crown. Charles VII., King of France, based his pretensions
to the throne on the ground that, had Ladislaus
lived, he would have been married to Charles’s
daughter. The Duke of Saxony pleaded that he had
actually married the sister of Ladislaus. The Dukes
of Austria tried to revive the recollection of the promise
of Charles IV.; while the King of Poland appealed
to the fact of his former election, which
had fallen into abeyance after the birth of Ladislaus.
Of these candidates, the King of France and
the Duke of Saxony seem to have been by far the
most pressing and sanguine in their candidature; and
both of them paid court to George; while both of
them hoped, by securing a dependency of Bohemia,
to get a footing in the kingdom before their actual
election. The King of France declared his intention
of taking Luxemburg under his special protection,
while William of Saxony appealed to the desire of
some of the Silesians to choose him as their ruler.</p>

<p>But both these candidates had reckoned their
chances without knowing the wishes of the two most
important men in Bohemia. George was determined
that Silesia should never be separated from the
Bohemian crown; and he had equally little wish
that any foreigner should again become king of
Bohemia. Rokycana, on his part, was not less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
determined that no one but George should be the
King. In addressing the Bohemian Assembly in
March, 1459, the Archbishop boldly grounded his
appeal for George not only on his Bohemian birth,
the purity of his life, and his proved power to defend
them against their enemies, but also on his devotion
to the Utraquist cause. Openly as this claim was
put forward, it does not seem to have alienated the
Roman Catholic nobles. George’s conciliatory
policy towards the Catholics, and his personal friendship
for some of their leaders, readily induced them
to acquiesce in an election which would secure a
strong national king to Bohemia. Yet from the very
first Rokycana succeeded in giving a Utraquist colouring
to the decision. While the envoys of Duke
William of Saxony were eagerly expecting the election
of their master, their meditations were interrupted
by a simultaneous burst of ringing from all the
churches in Prague; George speedily issued from
the Town Council House with the sword of honour
borne before him; and he was led across the square
to the Teyn Church, where, after a general singing
of the Te Deum, Rokycana called on the people to
thank God for giving them a king who would stand
by their faith.</p>

<p class="caption">GEORGE OF PODĔBRAD, FIRST HERETIC KING OF BOHEMIA.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus the election of George of Podĕbrad to the
throne of Bohemia marks the accession of the first
heretic king in the history of Europe. Doubtless the
name of heretic had been freely thrown at Henry IV.
by Hildebrand, at Barbarossa by Alexander III., and
at Frederick II. and Louis of Bavaria by every Pope
who came in contact with them; but every one knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
that that name was a mere term of abuse, of no more
special significance than “knave” or “ruffian”; and
that the real point at issue in those quarrels was
the question of the exercise of some form of
secular authority. George of Podĕbrad, on the other
hand, was deliberately recommended to the Assembly
of Bohemia, on account of his championship of a
purely ecclesiastical practice, which had been condemned
by one Council of the Church, and by one
Pope at least; and, although a later Council might
have partially and hesitatingly sanctioned the practice,
that Council had itself perished in an odour of heresy
and resistance to Papal authority.</p>

<p>Yet, strange to say, it was not till about four years
after George’s election that the Pope and the leaders
of the Church recognised the full significance of the
event which had taken place. This delay was due to
various causes. In the first place, George, who was
evidently conscious of the difficulties of his position,
and anxious to maintain his character of national
king, had begun his reign by making concessions to
the Catholics. Remembering that Rokycana had
never been formally recognised as Archbishop by any
ecclesiastical authority, he looked about for some more
legally appointed bishop, to consecrate him as king.
In this matter he was assisted by one whom he had
good reason to look to as his friend.</p>

<p>Immediately on the death of Ladislaus, the Hungarians
had decided to choose, as their king, Matthias,
the son of their great general Huniades. He had
been opposed to the rule of Ladislaus, and had even
raised insurrection against him. In one of the battles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
which followed, Matthias had been taken prisoner by
George, and brought to Prague. On the announcement,
however, of the Hungarian election, George at
once set his prisoner free, and sent him back to
Hungary as King. George now in turn appealed to
Matthias to send him over two bishops to crown
him King of Bohemia. Matthias readily consented;
and George promised at his coronation to suppress
heresy. A more satisfactory concession to Roman
Catholic feeling was the new arrangement for the
government of the diocese of Prague. The Dean of
Prague had claimed to administer the diocese, on
account of the heresies of Rokycana. The Archbishop,
naturally enough, protested; and George settled the
matter by granting the Dean authority over the
Catholic priests, while Rokycana was to retain his
authority over the Utraquists.</p>

<p>But apart from these concessions to Catholic feeling,
the position and policy of the Pope tended more than
anything else to delay, for a time, the collision between
him and the heretic king. In the very same
year in which George was chosen King of Bohemia,
Æneas Silvius Piccolomini was elected Pope of
Rome under the title of Pius II. He had been a
zealous champion of the Council of Basel, and had
vainly tried to make peace between it and Eugenius IV.
He was therefore not prepared at once to condemn a
practice which the Council of Basel had, at least conditionally,
sanctioned. Moreover, there was another
reason, which operated still more strongly to induce
him to make friends with the King of Bohemia. For
several years past, the most zealous Catholics of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Europe had been turning their attention away from
the divisions in their own Church, to watch with
terror the advance of the Turks in Europe; and,
since the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the sense of
the relative insignificance of every other question, in
comparison with the expulsion of the Mahometan
invaders, had been growing in the minds of all true
champions of Christendom. If, then, Pius II. could
succeed in winning to this cause the strong championship
of the new King, he might well wink, for a time,
at a few little heresies in doctrine and practice.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, there were other grounds of
opposition to George which were not so easily put
aside as mere suspicions of heresy might be. William
of Saxony was determined to make good his claim
on Silesia; and he was able to appeal to that sentiment
of provincial independence which had been
growing during the previous century. Neither
Z̆iz̆ka nor Procop had ever been able thoroughly to
establish the power of the Bohemians over Moravia
and Silesia; but the accession of a ruler, who seemed
to be acceptable to all parties in Bohemia, was likely
to strengthen the central power at the expense of
local aspirations. The Silesians and Moravians complained
that neither of their Assemblies had been
consulted in the election of George; and the towns of
Moravia, always jealous of the power of Prague, and
containing a strong admixture of German and Catholic
elements, were eager to resist the centralising power
of the heretic king. Albert of Austria was able to
give them little assistance; and one after another the
great cities of Moravia were reduced to obedience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Znaym (Znojem) was the first to open its gates to
George. Brünn (Brno), more strongly fortified, was
at first disposed to resist; but it soon yielded to the
threat of a siege; and Olmütz speedily followed its
example. In Iglau (Jíhlava) the Catholic reaction
had risen to a greater height than in any of the other
towns of Moravia; and the leaders of the party had
deposed the Town Council and appointed one of their
own; but, on being convinced that George intended
no persecution of the Catholics, Jíhlava also surrendered
to the king.</p>

<p>The resistance in Silesia was of a more determined
kind. Broken up as it was into little Dukedoms,
containing a strong German element, and often influenced
by its near neighbourhood to Saxony, Silesia
had probably at no time felt that strong sympathy
with the Bohemians which still existed in Moravia, in
spite of the apparent triumph of the Catholic reaction.
But the strongest opposition in Silesia came, not from
the provincial dukes, but from the town of Breslau.
The Bishop of Breslau seems to have been a more
zealous Catholic than most of his neighbours; while
the citizens had continual causes of rivalry with
Prague, both on account of trade differences and of
exceptional municipal privileges. Breslau, therefore,
held out against George, long after the rest of Silesia
had practically submitted to him. The Pope, still
hoping to secure the help of George against the Turks,
tried to persuade the Breslauer to submit to the King,
and answered to their complaints of George’s heresy
that it was for the Pope, and not for the town of
Breslau, to decide that question. At last, in 1460<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
George succeeded in bringing the Breslauer to terms;
but not till he had promised them considerable ecclesiastical
and municipal privileges, and had allowed
them to defer their homage to him for three years.</p>

<p>Bohemia, however, was not the sole obstacle to
the union of Christendom against the Turks. The
Emperors of Germany had been growing steadily
weaker during the last century; and many princes
had wearied of Frederick III.’s government, and were
looking about for a strong ruler who might put down
the divisions of the Empire, before leading them
against the Turks. Under these circumstances many
considered that George of Bohemia would be the
right man for the place. In Hungary, too, Matthias
had found great difficulty in holding his own against
the nobles; and there again, though much against his
will, George was looked upon as a possible substitute
for the unpopular king. In his own country he
seemed to be gaining steadily in power. He had
restored, to a great extent, the influence of the towns
which had been decaying during the Hussite wars,
and he gathered round him, not only the most eminent
men in Bohemia, but also the most distinguished
foreigners from Germany and Italy.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, Pius II. was becoming
alarmed at the power of this king. He had hoped
that George would have come to Rome to declare
himself a true son of the Church. He found that no
progress was being made in the anti-Turkish crusade;
and he heard, with alarm, that the Archbishop of
Mainz and other German ecclesiastics were preparing
to demand the fulfilment of that decree of the Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
of Constance, according to which a new Council was
to be summoned every ten years. These suspicions
of the Pope were much encouraged by one of his
advisers, Fantinus de Valle, who tried to convince
him that heresy had recently gained new life, and
that there was a special revival of the teaching of
Wyclif. At last in January, 1462, George consented
to send an embassy to Rome, stating the terms on
which he would make the necessary submission to
the Pope. This submission was to be given, practically,
on the recognition by Pius of the Compacts of
Basel. The Pope was, in the first place, indignant
that George should send representatives instead of
coming himself to Rome; and he was perhaps not
more favourably disposed to the deputation, that
Koranda, the Taborite preacher, was one of the
members of it; for Koranda dwelt with considerable
enthusiasm on the victories of the Taborites in the
Utraquist wars, and maintained that they had acted
by the grace of God, and by the enlightenment of
the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>At last on March 31st the Pope, in a large assembly,
declared that the Communion in both kinds, having
been condemned by the Council of Constance, and at
one time by the Council of Basel, must be considered
as a disorderly and heretical arrangement; that the
Compacts had been only a temporary provision; and
he now declared them at an end. The Bohemian
ambassadors, accompanied by Fantinus de Valle,
returned to Prague to report the news to the Assembly.
When they had delivered their report, George declared
that the Pope had no right to take away what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Council of Basel had conceded, and what Eugenius
had indirectly sanctioned. If any Pope, he said, may
undo what his predecessors have done, what security
is there for justice? Then, referring to the charge
that he had violated his coronation oath in not
suppressing heresy, he ordered the oath to be read
publicly. Then he proceeded to say that, in declaring
he would suppress heretical wickedness, he had never
meant that he would suppress Utraquism, since, said
he, “it is founded in the Gospel of Christ, according
to the institution of the primitive Church, and has
been conceded to us as a privilege of our virtue and
devotion, by the Council of Basel. And as to swearing
to oppose the practice, no indeed! But know for
certain that, since we were born in that Communion,
since we were nurtured in it, and since, by God’s help,
we have been raised to the royal dignity in it, so we
promise to guard and defend it, and to live and die
for it; and our wife and children, and all who do any
thing for the love of us, ought to live and die in the
defence of the Compacts; nor do we believe that
there is any other way of salvation for our souls than
the Communion in both kinds, according to the institution
of our Saviour.” Then he turned to the nobles
who stood about him, and asked them for their decision
on the question.</p>

<p>But it was no longer possible to maintain the former
unity in the face of this declaration; and while the
Utraquist nobles promised readily to stand by the
King, Sternberg declared, on behalf of the Catholics,
that, while they were willing to support the King in
all that concerned the honour of his kingdom, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
had not been consulted about the acceptance of the
Compacts, and that George must not look to them to
defend them. The next day Fantinus de Valle was
admitted to speak on behalf of the Pope. He at once
announced the revocation of the Compacts by Pius,
and the deposition from the clerical office of all who
gave the cup to the laity. Finally he wound up his
speech by fiercely threatening George with deposition
from his throne, if he did not obey the Pope. George
thereupon turned to the lords, who stood round him,
and said, “Noble lords, you chose me as your king and
protector; and since you have the power of choosing
a lord to protect you, you ought to work with him.”
He then burst out into a fierce denunciation of the
Roman see, declaring that it was a seat of pestilence;
and on the following day Fantinus was seized and
imprisoned.</p>

<p>The declaration of hostility seemed now sufficiently
clear on both sides; but again new considerations
delayed the final outburst. The Emperor Frederick
had just been engaged in a war with his brother Albert
about some claims in the Archduchy of Austria.
Albert succeeded in defeating the Emperor, and imprisoning
him at Vienna; but George hastened to
Vienna, rescued the Emperor, and restored him to the
throne. Frederick was full of gratitude; and, while
confirming all the liberties of Bohemia, he persuaded
the Pope to abstain from excommunicating George.
Pius, still bent on the Turkish war, and knowing
probably that Frederick would find some sympathy
for an anti-Papal policy, consented to a curious compromise.
He would not issue a formal Bull of anathema<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
against George; but he sent messengers to the citizens
of Breslau, releasing them from the treaty which they
had recently made, and encouraging them to rebel.
At the same time he tried to stir up discontent among
the nobles. Many of these had already become
alarmed at the growing power of their king.
Although he had strictly recognised the Constitutional
rights of the Assembly, yet the expedition to
Vienna had given an opportunity for reasserting one
of the privileges about which the Bohemian nobles
were most sensitive; namely, the power of refusing
to follow the King when he made war outside the
country. The opposition to this expedition was
speedily followed by fiercer attacks; and the lords
now accused George of illegal taxation, of interference
with the coinage, and of manipulating the land
register, so as to reduce to feudal submission those
who were legally independent. With regard to most
of the nobles, however, there seemed an unwillingness
at first to push things to an extremity; but a Moravian
named Hynek of Lichtenberg, who had long cherished
a personal jealousy against the king, broke out into
open insurrection, and set on fire some of the towns
in Moravia. Hoping to secure the Pope’s sympathy
in this rebellion, Hynek sent to Rome for advice as to
the course that he should pursue; but, before Pius
could commit himself to a distinct answer to this
question, he was taken ill, and died in August, 1464.</p>

<p>George was well pleased to hear that a Venetian
Cardinal had been elected Pope. But Paul II., though
at first apparently friendly to George, was irritated at
some delay in the formal congratulation on his accession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
which was due to him from the King of Bohemia.
Hynek soon succeeded in getting a ready hearing from
those Cardinals who were most opposed to George;
and, in spite of the protest of the Bishop of Olmütz
and of many leading people in Moravia, Paul was
induced to command George to withdraw his forces
from the siege of Hynek’s castle. George remonstrated
with the Pope; but the previous irritation was revived
by the rumour that George had refused to send
ambassadors for fear of their being ill-treated at
Rome. The continued attempts on Hynek’s castle,
and the renewal of the siege of Breslau, were treated
as acts of contumacy; and at last, on August 6, 1465,
Paul issued a Bull deposing George from the throne,
and authorising the legate to punish all who should
still adhere to him.</p>

<p>In the meantime the growing bitterness of the
Catholic nobles had been increased by a personal
quarrel between George and Zdenek of Sternberg.
Although George had been forced to rely upon this
nobleman in his attempts to conciliate the Catholics,
he soon found that Zdenek’s character was not deserving
of confidence; and he was forced to refuse
him a wardship, for which he applied, on the ground
that he had abused his trust on a former occasion. This
reproach roused Zdenek to still further opposition;
and he induced the lords to found a League in defence
of the Pope. The immediate object of Paul and the
rebel lords was to find a king for Bohemia; and they
fixed on Matthias of Hungary, who, though he owed
much friendship and help to George, was easily attracted
by the hope of a new kingdom. Many of the important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
towns of Bohemia fell away from the King, and joined
the lords against him. The four great towns of Moravia
formed a special League for the defence of the Catholic
faith. Pilsen and Budweis, always inclined to the
Catholic cause, speedily joined this League; and the
town of Görlitz, the centre of a special district in
Silesia, was hard pressed, on account of its loyalty to
the king. George was so eager for peace that he consented
to a meeting with the rebels at Prague, at
which he defended himself from the various charges
brought against him by the nobles; and he produced
some of the charters from Carlstein to prove the legality
of his actions. Sternberg refused to believe George’s
assertion that he had shown them all the charters
which concerned their rights; and he demanded that
Carlstein and its contents should be handed over to
himself and his friends, and that the charters should
be submitted to the Emperor for confirmation. George
indignantly refused these proposals, which apparently
went beyond the wishes of many of the lords; but
the Pope frightened the rebels into new opposition, by
another Bull which placed Bohemia under an interdict.</p>

<p>George now appealed from the Pope to a new
Council, and called on Casimir of Poland to intercede
between him and Paul. Casimir willingly undertook
this negotiation, to which some victories of George
seemed to give a hope of success; but the attempt at
compromise completely broke down; and the Poles
joined the anti-Utraquist alliance. Rosenberg, who
had stood by the King for some time, now went over
to Sternberg; and, when George advanced to besiege
Olmütz, his own soldiers deserted his banner. George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
was now compelled to retreat to Prague in April, 1469;
and the Legate supposed him to be so completely
crushed that he offered him the following terms of
peace. He was to return, with all his servants, to the
Catholic faith; to give up all Articles which the Church
condemned; to restore all ecclesiastical property; to
recognise Matthias as his son and successor, and allow
him to appoint the Archbishop and the heads of all
the churches in Prague; and, finally, to give up to the
Legate the <i>arch-heretic</i> Rokycana.</p>

<p>Not many even of George’s enemies could have
expected him to accept these terms; and the consequence
of their proposal was an exchange of fierce
defiances between the two parties, ending in a formal
election of Matthias as king of Bohemia, by the rebel
nobles. But the heretic King was not so easily to be
beaten. On January 1, 1470, he sent a letter to the
princes of the German Empire, which reads more like
the manifesto of a conqueror than the appeal of a
defeated and deposed king. He set forth in bitter
language the treatment which he had received from
the Pope; and he warned the princes that unless they
would support him in this crisis, he would break off
all connection between Bohemia and the Empire, and
stand alone.</p>

<p>In the meantime his enemies had begun to be divided
among themselves. The six towns, of which Görlitz
was the centre, had been forced to yield for a time to
the Catholic League and had been placed under the
rule of Sternberg’s son. They had soon found him
so oppressive that they revolted against him and drove
him out; and when Zdenek appealed to Matthias,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Matthias treated his complaints with contempt.
Rosenberg and Gutenstein returned to their allegiance
to George; and many of the towns of Silesia
and Moravia began to cry out against the government
of the League. Seizing this opportunity, George once
more invaded Moravia, and gained victory after victory
over Matthias.</p>

<p>The King of Hungary tried to redeem his cause by
making an inroad into Bohemia; but the cruelties of
the Hungarian soldiers led the common people to rise
against Matthias’s army; and the Poles seemed once
more friendlily disposed to their old allies. The
Bohemian lords gradually drifted back to George;
and the complaints of the Interdict were so loud in
the country that the Cardinals began to consider the
advisability of suspending it. But, before the victory
of the Bohemians could be secured, the struggle was
cut short by the death of King George, preceded, only
a few weeks earlier, by the death of his friend and
supporter, Archbishop Rokycana.</p>

<h2>XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE BOHEMIAN
BROTHERHOOD TO THE ACCESSION OF FERDINAND
I. TO THE THROWN OF BOHEMIA.<br />
(1419-1526.)</span></h2>

<p>Reference has already been made in the previous
chapters to a possible historical parallel between the
Bohemian struggle of the fifteenth century and the
English revolution of the seventeenth; but the most
startling point of that parallel has still to be mentioned.
Whatever likenesses or differences there may
be between the Calixtines and the Presbyterians, the
Taborites and the Independents, or between George
of Podĕbrad and Oliver Cromwell, there can, at least,
be no doubt that George Fox and his followers found
their prototypes in Bohemia in the fifteenth century;
and that the treatment which the Bohemian Quakers
received from the Utraquists, exactly foreshadowed
the persecution of the English Society of Friends by
their Puritan countrymen.</p>

<p>Yet even here we must note, by anticipation, an
important difference between the Bohemian and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
English story. It is perfectly possible to give an intelligent
and connected account of the English history
of the seventeenth century, without making more
than a casual reference to the Quaker movement.
For, important as the life of George Fox would be in
a general sketch of European philanthropy, it can
scarcely be said to form a necessary link between any
two periods of English history. On the other hand,
it is impossible to give a clear impression of the
Bohemian history of the sixteenth century without
calling considerable attention to the work and influence
of the Bohemian Brotherhood.</p>

<p>One reason for this difference is that the movement
for peace, and all the ideas that gather round
such a movement, were more in harmony with the
traditions of Bohemia than with those of England. This
statement may sound startling and paradoxical, when
it follows so closely on the account of the Utraquist
wars. They, more than any other event, have brought
Bohemia into prominence in European history; and
it was chiefly as fighters that the Bohemians were
known to the surrounding nations at the beginning of
the sixteenth century. Nevertheless, early traditions,
whether legendary or historical, never entirely lose
their influence on the character of a nation.</p>

<p>The gentle figure of Libus̆a presiding over a peaceable
community is a marked contrast to the figures
of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table;
and the essentially combative character of St. George
suggests directly opposite ideas of saintship to those
represented by St. Wenceslaus and St. Adalbert. Nor,
when the stream of religious tradition divides into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
the two branches of Catholic and Protestant, does the
contrast cease between the English and Bohemian
models. The legendary picture of St. John
Nepomuc is more gentle and suffering than even the
historical facts would justify, and it offers a strange
contrast to all the traditions that gather round the
name of Becket; while the loving and hesitating
character of Jan Hus is almost equally unlike the
sternly defiant figure of Wyclif.</p>

<p>There is, however, another reason for the difference
exercised on their respective countries by the Bohemian
and the English Society. While the stern
idealism of the Quakers hindered them from directly
influencing the ordinary course of public life, the
more accommodating character of the Bohemian
Brothers enabled them to affect the general policy of
their country by sacrificing something of their perfection
as a Christian community. This point of difference
will become more clearly evident as the story
proceeds; it will now be sufficient to have called
attention to the fact that, on both these grounds, the
followers of Peter of Chelc̆ic are more closely connected
with the course of Bohemian history than the
followers of George Fox with the history of England.</p>

<p>Peter of Chelc̆ic, like George Fox, was a shoemaker
by trade; but he educated himself carefully, both in
the Latin language and in the history of his country.
He does not seem ever to have wandered far from the
little village of Chelc̆ic, in the Prachin district; though
the narrowness of his geographical outlook did not
hinder him from plunging tolerably early into the
important controversies with which his life was concerned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
It was he who in 1419 propounded to the
Masters of the Prague University his doubts on the
lawfulness of religious wars. He was not satisfied
with the answer which he received; and the weakness
which he detected in Jakaubek’s arguments doubtless
strengthened him in his previous convictions.</p>

<p>He gradually adopted all those doctrines which we
specially associate with the name of George Fox. He
rejected all rank and property for Christians; declared
that the conversion of Constantine was the ruin of
the Church; condemned oaths in law courts, and
advocated the passive endurance of injuries.</p>

<p>He soon began to attract attention; and when
Peter Payne was driven out of Prague, after the
restoration of Sigismund, he took refuge at Chelc̆ic
with his namesake. Apparently a dislike of the new
teaching began, a little later, to show itself amongst
the Utraquists; for in 1443 we find that Peter was
summoned before an Assembly at Kutna Hora to
answer for his doctrines. Nothing seems to have
come of this examination, for Peter was soon after
allowed to publish his first book; and others speedily
followed, in which he attacked the Pope and the
clergy.</p>

<p>Just at this time Rokycana was engaged in a controversy
with the Franciscan Capistran; and, as he
had completely triumphed over the Taborites, he felt
ready to sympathise with a new ally against Rome. He
even recommended the writings of Peter to many of
his hearers in the Teyn Church; and Peter was
suffered to found a community which took the name of
the Chelc̆ic Brothers. Many of those who were desiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
to lead a purer and more self-denying life drew near
to the Brotherhood; and the protection and encouragement
of Rokycana gave the Society for a
time the means of easy development.</p>

<p>But after the coronation of George of Podĕbrad,
Rokycana’s feeling towards the Brothers underwent
a rapid change. His increase of power made him
more determined to assert that power at all hazards.
Had the Brothers, indeed, been contented to settle
under the priests whom the Archbishop chose for
them, Rokycana might still have suffered them to
remain unmolested; but he was irritated by their
desire to form a separate community of their own,
independent of all other ecclesiastical organisations.
While this controversy was still in its early stage,
Peter died, and his nephew Gregory succeeded to the
chief position in the society. The new movement
had now begun to include men of all classes, although
the nobles were expected to give up their rank if they
actually joined the Brotherhood.</p>

<p>But a more trying time was coming. In 1461,
Gregory came to Prague and held a meeting of his
friends in the New Town. This was the time when
Fantinus de Valle was beginning to excite the suspicions
of the Pope against the Bohemian heresies;
and, urged on doubtless by Rokycana, the King
ordered the arrest of the organisers of this meeting
on the charge of being engaged in a conspiracy. The
attempts to convict them of political intrigue entirely
broke down; and they were then denounced as heretics,
because of their denial of the doctrine of Transubstantiation.
Under pressure of torture, some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
them recanted, but Gregory remained firm. He reminded
Rokycana of his recommendation of the
works of Peter of Chelc̆ic, and he complained of the
Archbishop’s inconsistency in now denouncing them.
Rokycana, however, persisted in the course on which
he had entered, and he refused to allow the Brothers
any of the sacraments of the Church. The Brothers
now fled to the hills of Reichenau, and resolved to
form a stronger organisation for carrying on their
work.</p>

<p>With the curious inconsistency which naturally
attaches to such movements, they showed a great
desire to connect themselves, in tradition if not in
organisation, with the older churches; and they chose
as their chief president a regularly ordained priest,
named Michael. They elected a small council to
support him in his management of the Brotherhood;
and then they chose their priests by lot, and requested
them to rebaptise all the Brotherhood. Although,
too, they rejected Episcopacy as a separate dignity,
they practically entrusted to Michael the special
duties of a bishop. They now became known as
“Jednota Bratrska,” or the Unity of Brothers; and
they speedily began to attract attention from those
who were out of sympathy with the existing churches.
These were not confined to pure-minded and earnest
men like themselves, but included wild sects like the
Adamites, whom the Brotherhood were obliged to
repel from their body.</p>

<p>In the meantime Rokycana’s fury increased. He
stirred up both King and People against the Brotherhood,
and persuaded the Assembly to pass a decree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
ordering the suppression or compulsory conversion of
the Brothers. Again Gregory protested, and Rokycana
now answered that no new Church could be
founded without a special revelation from Heaven.
But when the Brothers offered to explain the nature
of their revelation, they were answered by imprisonment,
torture, and in some cases by burning. They
were now compelled to meet in woods, ditches, and
clefts of the rock to carry on their religious services;
yet they still stood firm, and Gregory and a woman
named Katerina succeeded in keeping up methods
of communication between them in various parts of
Bohemia and Moravia.</p>

<p>The deaths of King George and of Rokycana
released them for a time from persecution. The new
King showed himself more kindly towards them. This
King was Ladislaus, the son of the King of Poland.
He had been chosen King of Bohemia, in spite of
the resistance of Matthias. He was only sixteen
years old when he began to reign, and he seems to
have speedily left on people around him the impression
of a youth of mild and weak temperament. He
released the Brothers who were still in prison, and
they renewed their propaganda.</p>

<p>But their troubles were not yet at an end. Joanna,
the widow of King George, fiercely demanded their
suppression; and when they asked for a free discussion
on the points at issue, the Masters of the Prague
University informed them that they might come to
Prague to state their doctrines, and then submit to be
convinced of their errors by the Masters. This was
precisely what the Council of Basel had proposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
the Utraquists themselves, a proposal which they had
scornfully rejected; and the inconsistent character of
the claim made by the Utraquist leaders seems forcibly
to have impressed, not only their Catholic enemies,
but even some of their supporters.</p>

<p>Therefore, under the pressure of public opinion, the
Masters of the Prague University consented, in 1473,
to a discussion with the Brothers. Strangely enough,
the points which the Masters proposed for discussion
did not refer to the distinctive doctrines of Peter of
Chelc̆ic, but were rather concerned with the meaning
of the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, and the right
means of obtaining salvation. The Brotherhood
denied the doctrine of the Real Presence, and maintained
that salvation was only to be found in a virtuous
life; they were consequently denounced by the
Masters of Prague, and very little real discussion took
place. The Masters soon after issued a letter, in which
they declared that the Brothers were the chief enemies
of the Church; and they further complained of them
for choosing workmen for the office of priests.</p>

<p>It was during this phase of the controversy that
Gregory died. He had combined remarkable courage
with an unselfish devotion to the cause of the Brotherhood.
He had willingly resigned the first place in
favour of the priest Michael; but he had, none the
less, stamped his special convictions on the minds of
certain members of the Brotherhood; and, for a time,
on the constitution of the whole society. He warned
the Brothers very strongly against the dangerous
influence of learned scholars, declaring that such
people were given to subtle intrigues, inconsistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
with simplicity of life. At the same time he gave
enormous power into the hands of the Bishop of the
Church. He was to have the right of changing at
will the members of the Council who acted with him;
and no Brother was to be allowed to publish any book
without the sanction of the Bishop and this Council
of his nominees. More general questions of faith
and doctrine were to be decided by synods of the
Brotherhood.</p>

<p>Though Gregory’s immediate successor in the
Brotherhood was a man of like feelings with himself,
neither he nor any one else could ultimately maintain
so strict an organisation in its original form. It has,
indeed, already been hinted that the Bohemian
Brotherhood, unlike their English successors, came,
after a short time, into friendly contact with the outer
world; and they suffered in simplicity, while they
gained in influence.</p>

<p>They had now spread over a hundred and eighty
square miles of territory; and though they still for a
time maintained the exclusion of worldly rank and
worldly power from their body, they did not object
to accept the protection of friendly nobles, who
remained outside their body. Of these the most
prominent and sympathetic was Kostka of Postupic,
whose father had endeavoured to protect the Brothers
against King George, and whose great-grandfather
had fought for Z̆iz̆ka. Through his influence
many nobles were induced to modify that attitude
of hostility which the democratic tendencies of the
Brotherhood had naturally produced in them. But
this connection could not fail in time to produce a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
corresponding change in the feelings of the Brothers
themselves; and some of them began, before long, to
propose a modification of the stern principles which
Gregory had enforced. Might not oaths be used on
certain occasions? Say, for instance, to free a Brother
from unjust charges in a law-court? And might not
worldly offices be held, if they were administered in a
right spirit? These questions of practice, together
with others of pure doctrine, began gradually to
excite divisions in the Brotherhood; and, though it
was some time before the more moderate creed could
gain much ground, it soon found a powerful and
eloquent supporter, who knew how to make it acceptable.</p>

<p>About the year 1480, Lukas of Prague, a young and
learned theologian, was admitted into the Brotherhood.
He had studied the old classics and the Fathers of the
Church; and he was strongly in favour of a relaxation
of those stern simplicities on which Gregory had
insisted. He also desired to give greater prominence
to the doctrine of Justification by Faith, as distinguished
from that exclusive advocacy of good life
which had hitherto been the mark of the Brotherhood.
Under the influence of Lukas, it was resolved in 1490
that the heads of the congregations should be allowed
to relax the severity of the rules, on certain occasions,
in regard both to questions of luxury and to the
appeals to the secular power.</p>

<p>Amos of S̆tekna strongly denounced this compromise,
and declared that the devil of worldliness
had entered as thoroughly into the Brotherhood as
he had entered into the Church in the time of Constantine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
and Sylvester. Mathias of Kunvald, the
successor of Gregory in the leadership of the Brotherhood,
sympathised with the sterner party; and, by
his influence, the relaxing decrees were repealed.</p>

<p>A project was then started for sending expeditions
to various parts of the world, in order to find out
where the simplicity of faith was still maintained.
Nothing, however, seems to have resulted from these
visits; and the party of Lukas continued to gain
ground. Mathias was unable to hold his own against
the pressure of the new Reformers; so at last he
resigned his judgeship in despair, and consented to the
abolition of the Small Council. Thereupon Amos of
S̆tekna and his followers revolted from the Brotherhood,
and founded a new sect which was called, after
its founder, the Amosites. At the same time the old
society became generally known as the Bunzlau
Brothers, after the town of Jungbunzlau (Mláda
Boleslav) which was now their chief centre.</p>

<p>Two results followed from this separation; first,
an intensity of bitterness between the old Society and
the seceders, greater than that between the Utraquists
and the Brothers; and, secondly, the adoption of new
modifications and compromises by those who adhered
to the old Society. All compromises have a certain
want of logic about them; and compromises between
the Church and the World on such questions as war
and peace, simplicity and luxury, equality and distinctions
of rank, must necessarily produce results
which, while painful and pathetic to those who realise
the state of mind of their framers, will strike an unsympathising
world as grotesque and even ludicrous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>Under the new arrangements, the members of the
Brotherhood were allowed to wear dress in proportion
to their rank, if they did not become luxurious; but
silk and embroidery were still strictly forbidden. The
compromise about war was still stranger. If a
Brother considered that the war which his king had
made was a just one, he should not refuse to take part
in it if the lot fell upon him; but he was to try, whenever
possible, to find a substitute, or to get some
office about the Court which would excuse him from
military duty, or to find some service in connection
with the army which did not involve fighting; but if
he could not find any such means of escape, then let
him fight in God’s name; but let him not fight for
idle fame, and let him draw the sword with reluctance.</p>

<p>Some of the other modifications of principle seem
more in accordance with ordinary conceptions of life.
Trade might now be practised, but usury was to be
avoided. Beer might be sold, if pure; but it was only
to be sold in a public manner to travellers. Oaths,
again, might be taken by witnesses if they were convinced
of the justice of the cause in which they
appeared.</p>

<p>But though such relaxations permitted the extension
of membership to those who had hitherto been
excluded from the Brotherhood, the bonds of the
Society were drawn closer than ever round those
members who had entered it. Strict arrangements
were made for the visitation of the Brothers by their
clergy, and for inquiry into the morals of each
family; more rigid limitations than before were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
placed on the acquirement of property by the clergy
themselves, while the appeals to worldly law-courts
were more carefully guarded against by the provision
of Courts of Appeal within the Brotherhood. Lastly,
the exclusive position of the Brotherhood was
strengthened by a most startling provision; if a
husband or wife joined the Brotherhood without the
sympathy of their partner, and were afterwards interfered
with by him or her in matters of faith, the
brother or sister so hampered might claim a divorce,
and make a new marriage. Thus, then, the Brotherhood
seemed to be strengthened and consolidated,
both by the facilities of admission to those who had
been repelled by its sterner rules, and by the stricter
organisation which separated the enlarged Society
more distinctly from the outer world.</p>

<p>But an additional source of strength was soon to
be provided by the renewal of persecution. This
persecution was due to three causes. Soon after the
changes above mentioned, Lukas and some of the
other Brothers had made an expedition to Italy to
investigate the condition of the Waldensian Communities.
It was the time of the struggle between
Alexander VI. and Savonarola, and some of the
Bohemian missionaries were actually present in
Florence at the burning of the great Dominican.
They returned to Bohemia, offended at the laxity
of many of the Bohemian Communities, and more
embittered than before against a Catholic Church
which was ruled by Alexander Borgia. Alexander,
on his side, had been roused by his struggle against
Florence to a fervid zeal for the suppression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
heresy, and his attention had evidently been called to
these strange visitors to Italy. So in 1500 he despatched
inquisitors to Moravia with orders to burn all
heretical books, and especially those of Peter of
Chelc̆ic. So effectively was this part of the work
performed, that of the book which Peter had specially
written against the Pope, only one copy is to be found
at this day. The inquisitor, indeed, found it easier to
burn books than to convert the Brothers, but his
efforts in that direction were soon supported by men
of a very different type.</p>

<p>The first of these was Bohuslav Hassenstein of
Lobkovic, a learned and cultivated scholar, who
had gained some reputation as a poet. He had
quarrelled with Pope Alexander, in consequence of
the Pope’s refusal to confirm him in the bishopric
of Olmütz; and he was at first disposed to look
rather to King Ladislaus than to any ecclesiastical
authority for the restoration of unity and order in
the Church. He seems indeed to have had some
genuine zeal for moral reform; for he denounced the
luxury and pride of the nobility; the gluttony,
drunkenness, and debauchery of all classes; and the
general decline of art and literature. For all these
evils he suggested the one remedy&mdash;that Ladislaus
should restore religious unity to the Church. But,
like every earnest man who came in contact with this
unfortunate king, Hassenstein began by admiring his
gentleness, and ended by despising his weakness and
incapacity. Since the death of Matthias, Ladislaus
had been elected King of Hungary; and, if he had
been unable to govern Bohemia effectively from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Prague, he was still less able to govern it from
Presburg. Hassenstein, in despair, turned to his
clerical brethren for help; and they resolved to promote
religious unity by a friendly compromise with
the Utraquists, which was to be a preparation for a
joint persecution of the Brotherhood.</p>

<p>But a third enemy of the Brothers proved more
efficacious than Borgia or Hassenstein in stirring up
the embers of persecution. Amos of S̆tekna had
heard with renewed indignation of the later modification
of their creed introduced by the Brothers after
his secession; and he had particularly resented the
compromises with regard to war, and the completer
recognition of the civil power. He, therefore, wrote
to Ladislaus that the Brothers were now taking up
the position of the old Taborites. The suggestion
was the one best fitted to alarm such a man.
“What!” exclaimed the king, “are they going to
imitate Z̆iz̆ka?” (Z̆iz̆kovati), and he at once rushed
into action with all the irritable energy of a weak
nature.</p>

<p>Orders were now sent out to all those towns and
country districts which were directly dependent upon
the King, directing them to suppress the meetings of
the Brothers, to arrest all their teachers, and to send
them to Prague, where they would either be forced
to recant, or else be burnt alive; and these measures
were to be followed by the expulsion of the rest of
the Brotherhood from Bohemia. Many wholesale
arrests were made; and one nobleman burnt some
of the Brothers whom he found on his estate.</p>

<p>But these summary proceedings of the King roused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
against him the constitutional feelings both of the
nobility and of the representatives of the towns.
They disputed his right to act in so arbitrary a
manner, even in the districts dependent upon him;
and they feared that he would soon exert the same
power in the independent towns and on the estates
of the nobles.</p>

<p>Apart from these general objections, there were
three noblemen, at least, who were disposed to extend
their protection to the Brothers; and it was on their
estates that the largest number of the Brothers were
to be found. Different motives actuated the nobles
who took this course. Kostka, who has been already
referred to, sympathised personally with the teaching
of the Brotherhood; Schellenberg wished to spare
them, because his wife was a member of their society;
Pernstein was entirely indifferent to all theological
disputes, and therefore saw no reason for the persecution.
But all the three were united in the determination
to assert their feudal rights for the protection
of their dependants; and they insisted that, if any
Brothers were summoned to Prague from their
estates, they should be secured complete protection
and a fair hearing.</p>

<p>When, however, the Brothers arrived in Prague,
they found that the Committee of the Masters of Arts
intended to administer a rebuke, without hearing the
defence of the accused parties. Against this injustice
the Brothers protested; and at last the nobles and
citizens succeeded in persuading the Masters to withdraw,
before the accused persons were introduced.
When, then, the Brothers appeared to answer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
charges against them, they found themselves in the
presence only of the nobles and citizens, who informed
them that their mere appearance in Prague
was all that was required of them, and that they
might now go home again. This result was considered
to be, in the main, a victory for the Brothers.
But some of them were more indignant at the time
which had been wasted than pleased at their escape
from condemnation; and Lukas and his friends followed
up this visit by an energetic war of pamphlets.</p>

<p>A new weapon, it must be remembered, was now
at the service of all promoters of new teaching. The
invention of printing had quickly spread to Bohemia;
and, in 1468, the fourth printing-press ever established
in Europe had begun to work at Pilsen. The
Brothers quickly saw the advantage of the new discovery;
and, in 1500, they established a printing-press
at Mláda Boleslav. More than one lady of rank
joined the Brotherhood; and at least one Catholic
noble found the new creed rapidly spreading among
his dependants.</p>

<p>Ladislaus now recognised the mistake which he
had made in ignoring the constitutional methods of
procedure. He therefore resolved to appeal to the
regular Assemblies for support in his war against
heresy; and he believed that he would find his best
chance in Moravia. The Moravian Assembly, unlike
the Bohemian, admitted the clergy to a special representation
as a fourth estate; the Bishop of Olmütz
had been active in the propaganda against the
Brotherhood; and the great power which the Germans
and Catholics had obtained in Moravia during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
the wars, seemed to point to an easy victory in the
Moravian Assembly.</p>

<p>But again the King had miscalculated. The victories
of the Germans and Catholics had excited
against them a bitterness, both national and religious,
far more intense than was to be found in other parts
of the kingdom. The cruelties of Sigismund, the
Germanising zeal of Albert of Austria, and the many
injustices of Sternberg and the Catholic League, had
consolidated against them a mass of Moravian feeling,
which, if unable to secure victories on the battlefield,
was eminently calculated to give strength to an
opposition in the Assembly. To the Bohemians of
the western province the Catholics and Germans were
enemies, whom they had met on equal terms and
often thoroughly routed; to the Moravians they were
victorious tyrants, whose rule was to be thrown off at
the first opportunity.</p>

<p>When, then, the Catholics demanded that the
Assembly should unite in suppressing the “Picard”
heresy, they were startled to find that the Utraquists
made common cause with the Brothers in opposing
this motion, and that they actually chose as their
spokesman a member of the Brotherhood named John
of Z̆erotin. This nobleman demanded that the complaints
already made by the Utraquists should be
attended to before the question of supposed heresy
was dealt with. The Bishop of Olmütz taunted
Z̆erotin with professing a sympathy with the Utraquists
which he did not feel; but the Opposition
remained firm; and the Assembly broke up without
coming to any decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>In Bohemia the Catholic party had an easier task.
The opposition to Ladislaus’s former proceedings had
been mainly based on constitutional grounds; and it
now appeared that there was little religious sympathy
with the Brotherhood amongst the leaders of
public opinion. The power which the Utraquists
had gained during the reign of King George had
drawn them into sympathy with the leading nobles;
and Rokycana had inspired them with a special dislike
of the Brotherhood. The Bohemian Assembly, therefore,
consented to a decree, which ordered the burning
of the books of the Brotherhood, the suppression of
their meetings, and the punishment of their teachers.
Elated by this victory, the Bishop of Olmütz hurried
back to Moravia, intending to summon the Assembly
for a second meeting, and to secure the reversal of
its former decision; but he was taken ill on his way,
and died before the Assembly could meet; nor, from
that time till the fall of Bohemian independence in
1620, did any Moravian Assembly consent to the
suppression of the Brotherhood.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Catholic party found full compensation
for their failure in Moravia in a specially
fierce enforcement of the law just passed in Bohemia.
Indeed, the former patrons of the Brotherhood became
so much alarmed, that even Kostka forbade the
Brothers to hold any further meetings on his estates.
In spite of this opposition, the Brothers still
maintained their ground, and even extended their
preaching further; and but few of them could be
persuaded, even by the most cruel tortures, to submit
to the authorities of the Church. In 1511 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
Brothers hoped, for a short time, to secure the protection
of the greatest scholar of the time, Erasmus
of Rotterdam. They had heard of some private
letters of his, in which he had defended them against
the attacks of their enemies; and they now prepared
a Defence in Latin, which they sent to him. He
thanked them for their communication, and expressed
approval of at least part of their defence; but he
declined to publish his opinion, on the ground that it
would not help them, and might injure his work. So
the persecution went on. Even Peter of Rosenberg
found himself unable to protect a Brother, in whom
he was interested, from being imprisoned and nearly
starved to death. He succeeded, indeed, in getting
him released before death had actually occurred, and
he then urged him to submit to the Church; but the
Brother, though almost too exhausted to speak,
steadily refused to submit; and he was set free without
further persecution. Lukas, who was now the
most prominent member of the Brotherhood, succeeded
for a long time in escaping the vigilance of
his persecutors; but, in 1515, he was treacherously
seized under false pretences, brought to Prague, and
subjected to the torture. When nothing could be
obtained from him by this means, he was set free,
on the understanding that he was to appear before
the Utraquist Consistory in April, 1516; but in the
month before this appearance was to take place King
Ladislaus died, and the persecution again slackened
for a time.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the long absence of the King in
Hungary, and the growing sense of his weakness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
character, had been producing other divisions in
Bohemia which gradually turned men’s minds away
from the religious controversies. The wars of the
fifteenth century, like all wars, had tended to draw
the people away from their ordinary occupations, and
to make them dependent on their military leaders.
As long as the Taborite organisation lasted, its
democratic spirit provided at least some check on
the oppressions of the military nobles; and the
alliance between the peasants and the Order of
Knights, to which Z̆iz̆ka had belonged, counteracted
any advantages which the nobles might have gained
by their military prowess. But the fall of Tabor had
destroyed any hopes, which the peasantry and townsmen
might have had, of strengthening their position
through war.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the peasantry gradually
fell back into the condition from which they had been
escaping in the fourteenth century. The right of
leaving their masters at their pleasure, of settling in
towns, and of becoming priests without the sanction
of their landlords, were gradually taken from them;
and at last they were deprived even of that right of
appeal to the King’s Court by which Charles had
protected them against the absolute power of their
lords.</p>

<p>But, though the peasantry were thus crushed back
into a state of serfdom, the organisation of the towns
was too strong to yield at once to the attacks of the
nobles. Unfortunately, however, the lords gained
about this time a new and important ally in their
struggle for supremacy. The knights, or independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
country gentlemen, who had been such zealous
rivals of the higher Order in the fifteenth century,
had lately consented to a reconciliation with their
opponents; and these two classes were thus able to
combine their forces against the towns.</p>

<p>The new king was little able to give the weaker
party any assistance in the struggle. Ladislaus had
succeeded in securing to his son Louis the succession
to the crown, and he had even had him crowned
during his lifetime. But Louis was a boy of ten;
he was in the main under Hungarian influences; and
he was of course utterly unfitted to control the fierce
factions which were struggling in Bohemia.</p>

<p>The three chief points at issue between the Towns
and the other Orders were, firstly, the right of the
Town Tribunals to summon before them the nobles
and knights in cases specially affecting the towns;
secondly, the monopoly claimed by the towns in the
brewing trade; thirdly, the right of the towns to send
representatives to the Bohemian Assembly. In 1517,
indeed, a nominal settlement was effected on all these
points by the treaty of St. Wenceslaus. By that
treaty the towns surrendered their monopoly of
brewing, but were secured the peaceable possession
of their other privileges. Such treaties had little
effect in a time of discord, and it was not long before
a new violation of town rights led to the outbreak of
a civil war, in which the citizens gained some victories.
Both parties, however, soon began to desire peace, and
the king was called in to arbitrate between them.</p>

<p>When Louis arrived in Prague to inquire into the
circumstances of the contest, he found that the disturbances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
of the country had been largely increased
by the rise of certain self-seeking politicians, who had
made their profit out of the difficulties of the kingdom.
Of these the most powerful and unscrupulous
was Lev of Roz̆mital, the brother-in-law of King
George. He had induced Ladislaus to mortgage to
him some of the royal property. By this and other
means he had gained a great control over the finances
of the kingdom, and he refused to give any account
of his use of that power. He was supported in most
of his intrigues by a citizen who had recently been
ennobled, and who had taken the name of Pas̆ek of
Wrat. These two men had gradually gained complete
power over the government of Prague; and, on
one occasion, a man who had opposed Lev in the
Town Council had been dragged out and beaten to
death.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, there were powerful influences
in the country which worked in favour of
the young king. One of the Rosenbergs of Krumov
was a rival and enemy of Lev; and an equally formidable
opponent of these schemes was found in
Karl, Duke of Münsterberg, and nephew of King
George. Louis’s uncle, King Sigismund of Poland
readily supported his nephew by advice and encouragement.
The respectable citizens of Prague
were willing to rally round him; and, with such
friends as these, the boy could venture to act vigorously.
He deposed Lev from his office, raised a
citizen named Hlavsa to the place which Pas̆ek had
formerly held on the Council, and made Karl of
Münsterberg the chief governor of the kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>This change of government was intended by Louis
and his nearest advisers simply as a means of restoring
order and honesty in public affairs; but, besides
that result, his action produced another effect, of
which neither the King nor his uncle Sigismund would
have approved. In choosing his new Councillors from
the most respectable politicians whom he could find,
Louis had unintentionally singled out men who were
in sympathy with the movement for religious reform.</p>

<p>That movement had recently entered on an entirely
new phase. In the middle of the exciting political
struggles in their own country, many of the Utraquists
and Bohemian Brothers had heard with the
greatest interest that a German monk had come
forward to denounce that very practice of the Sale
of Indulgences which had first brought Hus into
direct collision with the Papacy; and a rapid approximation
followed between a section of the Bohemian
Reformers and the new German teacher.</p>

<p>Luther’s attitude towards the followers of Hus is
made clear enough by his own statements. He had
been induced to read the story of Hus’s career before
he had entered on his actual contest with Rome. He
had even then been impressed by the greatness of
the Bohemian Reformer, but he had thrust the book
aside as likely to lead him into evil. Something of
this old feeling still hung about him in the early part
of his struggle. And, when Eck brought against him
the charge of favouring the Bohemian heresy, he had
been inclined to repel it with indignation. Yet it was
that very charge which had induced him to return to
the study of Hus; and he soon began to express so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
earnest an admiration for the Bohemian leader that
his enemies spread the rumour that he was himself a
Bohemian, who had been educated in Prague on the
writings of Wyclif. Nay, they even went so far as
to Bohemianise his name&mdash;a change in which they
doubtless took a malicious pleasure, for the Bohemian
word “Lŭtr̆e” means a scoundrel. Several letters of
encouragement from scholars and clergymen at
Prague were addressed to Luther in the earliest years
of his struggle; and he declared that he would himself
have come to Bohemia had he not feared that
such a visit would have seemed like a flight from his
enemies.</p>

<p>But he very soon began to recognise the distinction
between his own position and that of Hus. This
difference he has referred to in several of his writings;
and perhaps the passage in his “Table Talk” is the
one which will be best remembered, from the vigorous
metaphor by which he illustrates his opinion: “Hus,”
he said, “cut down and rooted out some thorns,
thickets, and chips from the vineyard of Christ, and
chastised the abuses and evil life of the Pope. But
I, Dr. Martin Luther, have come into an open, flat,
and well-ploughed field, and have attacked and overthrown
the doctrine of the Pope.”</p>

<p>If this distinction between the attacks of Hus on
the immorality of the Papacy, and his own attack on
its doctrines, seemed to Luther to put the earlier
Reformer in a less important position than that
which he himself occupied, he must have felt this
difference still more strongly with regard to the later
Utraquistic movement. Very few of the leaders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
that movement had ever desired that complete
separation from Rome which Luther soon perceived
to be an absolute necessity. They had been driven,
against their will, to combine the assertion of their
national independence with resistance to the authority
of the Pope; but, when the deaths of King George
and Rokycana had removed at once the main ground
of Papal hostility to Bohemia, and the most determined
asserters of an independent national Church,
the Utraquists began to show an even painful eagerness
for a reconciliation with the Papacy. They felt
the need of a priesthood which possessed the dignity
and legal stability secured by the consecration of
Romanist bishops; and they not only sent their
clergy to Italy to obtain this privilege, but they even
welcomed in priests of other countries, who had been
appointed to their offices in the orthodox manner.</p>

<p>Luther, in his desire to win the Bohemians to his
side, energetically protested against this practice.
He pointed out to them the dangers to morality and
order which they were incurring by letting in priests
of whom they knew nothing, except that they had
been consecrated; men who, in many cases, had left
their country from discreditable reasons. Finally, he
appealed to them not to sacrifice that Bohemian
independence for which they had struggled so long,
nor to compromise with the representatives of those
who had shed the blood of Hus and Jerom.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Luther himself fell into the very
same error against which he had so energetically
warned the Bohemians. During these negotiations
he put his chief trust in a man who was totally unworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of his confidence. This was Gallus Cahera,
the son of a butcher of Prague, who had studied in
the University and gained a Master’s degree. He
had then taken Holy Orders, and been appointed
parish priest of Litmerice. From thence he had
gone to Wittenberg; and so completely did he gain
the confidence of the Reformers that, in 1523, Luther
sent him back to Prague with letters to the Utraquistic
congregation, urging them to choose him as
their leader in the work of reform. He arrived there
just when Louis was accomplishing his changes in
the administration of Bohemia. In the following
year the Utraquists elected Cahera as the Administrator
of their Consistory; and he proceeded to draw
up a series of Articles for their acceptance, which
approached nearer than any of their previous formularies
to the Lutheran creed. A proposal, indeed,
to condemn the celibacy of the clergy was rejected by
the Assembly; but the Articles which were adopted
were sufficiently extreme to alarm the old-fashioned
Utraquists; and Pas̆ek and his friends began at once
to make use of this feeling.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Utraquism had
always been most powerful when it had been connected
with efforts for Bohemian independence; and,
unfortunately, the national feeling of Bohemia was
generally closely connected with a hatred of all
German influence. Pas̆ek had been able to appeal
to this prejudice, in resisting the appointment of
Karl of Münsterberg, who was not a Bohemian by
birth; and, though the hatred of the tyranny of Lev
and Pas̆ek had been strong enough for the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
to destroy the effect of this appeal, yet the dread of
a German heresy was easily awakened in the citizens
of Prague. Louis had already called on the Moravian
Assembly to condemn the new doctrines; and that
body, which had defended the national movement
of the Bohemian Brotherhood, readily denounced the
teaching of the monk of Wittenberg.</p>

<p>Pas̆ek soon succeeded in gaining help from an
unexpected quarter. Cahera was a weak and unprincipled
man, and his opponents were easily able
to work upon his vanity. They proposed to him the
splendid task of reconciling the Utraquists to the
Pope; and Cahera was so dazzled by the prospect of
the fame and dignity which such an undertaking
promised him, that he quickly drifted away from his
former friends and helped forward Pas̆ek’s intrigues.
In vain did Luther remonstrate with Cahera on this
desertion of his principles. The reaction steadily
went on. Pas̆ek was re-elected to the Council;
Louis, forgetful of his former distrust, encouraged
the town in its new course; Karl of Münsterberg
came over to the Catholic side; and the Assembly
of Bohemia once more appealed to the Pope to ratify
the Compacts of Basel.</p>

<p>But Pas̆ek was not yet satisfied. He and Lev of
Roz̆mital were determined to recover the power which
they had lost; and they found that the discovery
and denunciation of heretics were the easiest means
of obtaining this end. They therefore seized the
opportunity of Cahera’s change of policy to pass
laws to strengthen the position of the Administrator
of the Consistory. At the same time some Lutheran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
sympathisers were expelled from Prague, and a
regular organisation was formed in the Small Division
to crush opposition. The Reformers soon began to
complain of the armed men who were allowed to
parade the streets. But these complaints were quoted
by Pas̆ek’s friends as evidence of an heretical plot.
Suspicion was stirred up against those reforming
clergy who still remained in Prague, and at last a
tradesman named Zika appeared before the Council
to denounce all those leading councillors who were
opposed to Pas̆ek. Hlavsa and his friends were
seized and thrown into prison, and Pas̆ek endeavoured
to obtain evidence against his leading opponents
by putting their followers to the torture. Lev of
Roz̆mital was restored to all his former power, and a
system of terror was gradually established, under
which the Brothers and all Lutheran sympathisers
were subjected to various kinds of persecution. Karl
of Münsterberg tried at first to check the progress of
this tyranny; but the intriguers had succeeded for a
time in winning to their side the king and the Hungarian
bishops, and by their influence the opposition
of the governor was silenced.</p>

<p>A general atmosphere of suspicion now began to
dominate the city and its neighbourhood. Private
avarice and vindictiveness found their opportunity
under the plea of orthodoxy. Men stopping to
speak to each other in the streets were accused of
heretical conspiracies, and the enforcement of a more
rigorous form of confession put a powerful weapon
into the hands of the persecutors. Many workmen
were deprived of their means of livelihood by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
espionage to which they were subjected, and citizens
coming to Prague to claim their debts were thrown
into prison on a charge of heresy.</p>

<p>Such a tyranny necessarily overshot its mark.
Many of the nobles were indignant at the power
which Roz̆mital had gained, and he soon received
a startling proof of their hostility. Remembering
the bait by which they had drawn Cahera to their
side, Pas̆ek and Roz̆mital despatched an embassy to
the king, who was then at Presburg, to persuade him
to second them in an appeal to the Pope to ratify the
Compacts of Basel. The Rosenbergs seized this
opportunity for a blow at the new rulers of Prague.
They despatched a counter embassy to the king, in
which they denied Roz̆mital’s right to speak in the
name of the nobles of Bohemia.</p>

<p>A still more impressive protest followed. Hlavsa
and one of his friends had escaped from prison, and
they now appeared in Presburg to convince the king
of the injustice of their imprisonment. They showed,
too, that Roz̆mital and his friends had exceeded the
powers granted to them, and had inflicted sentences
which were greater than any that the king had permitted.
Louis was impressed by these statements,
and he at once wrote to Roz̆mital, ordering him to
reverse his illegal sentences, to give Hlavsa and his
friends a fair trial, and to restore order and justice in
Prague.</p>

<p>Karl of Münsterberg and Lev of Roz̆mital combined
to defy the king’s commands; and after vainly
appealing to the Town Council of Prague to resist
this act of rebellion, the king summoned a Bohemian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Assembly to meet at the town of Kolin on the Elbe,
and excluded from its deliberations Karl, Lev, and
all their supporters. He then secured the trial and
acquittal of Hlavsa and his friends, and punished
Prague for its contumacy by depriving it of its civic
rights. So far, however, were the Praguer from
yielding that they now expelled from the city the
wives of the men whom they had been ordered to
recall; and they even imprisoned a citizen whom
Louis had sent to Prague to recover the property of
which the Town Council had deprived him.</p>

<p>But, absolute as was Roz̆mital’s rule within the
walls of Prague, a curious story of the time reminds
us of the formidable influences which were counteracting
his power in other parts of Bohemia. Peter
of Rosenberg had bequeathed to Roz̆mital the castle
and town of Krumov; but Peter’s nephew, Henry of
Rosenberg, maintained that such an alienation of the
property was contrary to the settlements under which
it was held. Lev thereupon summoned Henry to
appear before the law court in Prague, to answer for
his resistance to his uncle’s will. When the messengers
appeared at Krumov with the letters of
summons, Henry of Rosenberg at once threw them
into prison. He then summoned them before him,
made them eat the letters which they had brought,
gave them wine to enable them to swallow this
strange food, and then hunted them with dogs from
the gates of his castle.</p>

<p>Although this story shows that Roz̆mital’s power
was confined within certain local limits, yet, within
those limits, he could not only resist the remonstrances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
and commands of Louis, but could even hamper in
an important way his general schemes of policy.
This power for evil was shortly to receive a terrible
manifestation. While the Bohemians and Hungarians
had been wrangling, the Turks had been steadily
advancing in Europe. Soliman the Great had considerably
increased the military prestige of his race;
and Louis was startled, in the middle of his domestic
troubles, by the news that Belgrade had been captured
by the Turks. Then the young king appealed
to the Bohemians to stand by him and his Hungarian
subjects in their resistance to this terrible invader.
The Rosenbergs and other nobles responded to this
appeal; but Roz̆mital and the Council of Prague,
while ashamed to give a direct refusal, yet succeeded
in inventing all manner of delays, so as to prevent
their troops from coming in time to the king’s help.
Some of the Bohemian nobles wished to wait till
their whole forces were gathered, but the Hungarians
soon grew impatient of delay, and on the 29th of
August, 1526, they insisted on joining battle with
the Turks at Mohács. Louis, anticipating a certain
defeat, fled from the field before the battle began;
but, in his flight, his horse fell into a swamp, and his
unfortunate life of failure was cut short at the age of
twenty.</p>

<p>The result of the battle was as Louis had foreseen.
The Hungarians were signally defeated, and the
Turks speedily followed up their victory by the
capture of the fortress of Buda. A long series of
intrigues followed in Bohemia. The Austrian party
were supported by the Rosenbergs, and the Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
party were led by Lev of Roz̆mital; but the opposition
of Lev was finally bought off, and the Archduke
Ferdinand, brother of the Emperor Charles, and
brother-in-law of the unfortunate Louis, was elected
king of Bohemia.</p>

<h2>XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">REIGN OF FERDINAND I.<br />
(1526-1564.)</span></h2>

<p>Although Ferdinand was known, and to some
extent feared, as a stern and rigid Spaniard, yet a
belief in his desire for justice, and a wish to secure
any strong protector against the champions of disorder
in Bohemia, quite overbalanced any fears that
might be caused by his Catholic tendencies. Indeed,
although many stipulations were made before he was
accepted as king, the fears of his subjects were far
less excited about those religious liberties for which
they had so long struggled than about questions of
national independence. The dangers which seemed
most to threaten Bohemian liberty were the possibility
of Ferdinand’s election to the throne of Spain,
and the extreme probability of his election to the
throne of Hungary; while the subjects which ranked
next in importance to these were the maintenance of
the right of the Assembly to elect their future King,
and the preservation of the supremacy of Bohemia
over the dependent crown lands.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, did the controversies at the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
of a reign more completely fail to foreshadow
the events which should make it memorable. Ferdinand
himself was as blind to the issues before him as
were the people whom he came to rule. He thought
that in the local independence of Moravia and Silesia,
which had been so much increased by their frequent
separation from Bohemia in the late wars, he would
find an admirable opportunity for strengthening his
position at the expense of the Bohemians. At first his
theory appeared plausible enough; for the Moravians
and Silesians, indignant at not being consulted in the
first election of Ferdinand, were easily flattered by
his apparent tenderness for their provincial feelings;
and they consented to a concession to his wishes,
which the Bohemians had refused to make; for while
the Bohemians would only recognise Ferdinand as
their freely elected King, the Moravians and Silesians
consented to admit his hereditary claim to the throne,
and consequently fixed the crown more permanently
on the House of Hapsburg. But even the Bohemians
finally agreed that, if Ferdinand should find himself
incapacitated by old age or ill-health, he might commit
the task of government to his son Maximilian.
Ferdinand doubtless hoped that both these concessions
would tend to consolidate the power of the
House of Hapsburg, and to strengthen his personal
influence, as well as his legal claims; but before the
end of his reign he had cause to regret most bitterly
the increase of the Moravian independence, and to
grudge the power which he had conferred on a son,
who seemed determined to reverse the most important
points of his father’s policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>For the moment, however, his own thoughts and
those of the country which he governed were concentrated
on the struggle in Hungary. John Zapolya,
the Voyvode of Transylvania, had begun, even before
the death of Louis, to show signs of an ambition
which would carry him far beyond the limits of his
small principality; and he was strongly suspected of
having intrigued with the Turks at the battle of
Mohács. After the death of Louis, the intrigues and
claims of Zapolya rapidly increased, and he was at
last crowned king of Hungary. Ferdinand, however,
as brother-in-law of Louis, was resolved to dispute
Zapolya’s claim; nor was this desire due to a mere
greed of territory. The growing power of Soliman
the Great was becoming a serious danger to the peace
and liberty of Europe; and Ferdinand felt that the
possession of the crown of Hungary would enable
him to protect his hereditary dominions, and, indeed,
the whole Empire, against the aggressions of the
Turk. It must be owned that, considering Zapolya’s
evident inclination to intrigue with Soliman, Ferdinand’s
conception of duty was not by any means
unreasonable.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the feeling in Bohemia was
considerably divided. In spite of the dislike of the
Turk, which was then common to all Christian
nations, the Bohemians looked with alarm on any
increase in those burdens of taxation which already
weighed so heavily upon them; and, as already
hinted, they dreaded the rule of a King, who might
find it more convenient to reign at Presburg than
at Prague. So strong was this feeling, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
Bavarians, who had hoped to win the crown of
Bohemia for their Duke, now believed that they could
form a Bohemian party, which should commit itself
openly to the side of Zapolya. On the other hand,
the men of Prague, who groaned under the tyranny
of Pas̆ek and Cahera, had reason for hoping that
Ferdinand would come to deliver them from their
sufferings. He had already set free a friar who had
been imprisoned by Pas̆ek for denouncing his government;
and he had given the citizens good reason to
believe that nothing but the Hungarian war was preventing
him from doing justice and restoring order in
Prague. Those citizens, therefore, eagerly desired
his success; and as long as the struggle was mainly
between Ferdinand and Zapolya, the victory seemed
likely to fall to the Austrians.</p>

<p>Ferdinand returned in triumph to Prague; and, as
the first step towards the restoration of order, he
deposed the Councillors, who had been governing the
city, and restored the separate jurisdictions of the Old
and New Towns. In previous times, indeed, the union
of the different quarters of the city had been looked
upon as a means of securing the liberties of Prague;
but Pas̆ek and Cahera had turned this union into so
effective a means of tyranny over the freer spirits of
the New Town, that the citizens of the latter district
hailed the separation with enthusiasm; and they
declared that their beloved King Charles had returned
to earth in the form of their new ruler. This
exultation was soon cut short by a new, and far more
dangerous, outbreak of the Hungarian war. Soliman,
no longer relying mainly on the intrigues of Zapolya,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
poured his forces anew into Hungary, reconquered all
the territory which had been lost, marched into
Austria, and rapidly approached Vienna. Even now,
though they sent troops to the defence of Vienna, the
help of the Bohemians was grudgingly given, and was
hindered by their old suspicion of the power of the
Germans. Nevertheless, they joined in the war.
The Viennese were roused to an heroic resistance;
and, after a fierce struggle, the Turks were driven
back from the walls of Vienna. The ships which
Soliman had brought into the Danube were destroyed;
and he was compelled, for a time, to make peace.</p>

<p>Ferdinand now hastened back to Prague, and found
that Pas̆ek and Cahera had recovered their power in
the city. Although Hlavsa and his friends had been
allowed by Ferdinand to return from exile, Pas̆ek’s
party had succeeded in hampering their freedom and
annoying them in various ways. Knowing the King’s
strong Catholic feelings, Pas̆ek had hoped to conciliate
his favour by giving a religious colouring to his persecution;
and several of the Bohemian Brothers had
been singled out for torture and burning. But Ferdinand
seems to have thoroughly understood the
self-seeking character of the intriguers who were
governing Prague; and, resolving to show that he was
not to be trifled with, he banished Pas̆ek and Cahera
from Prague, and pronounced the formal acquittal of
Hlavsa and his friends. Even those against whom
there was reasonable suspicion of heresy were allowed
to escape by the use of elastic formulæ; and it seemed
for the moment as if a happier and better government
were really to be introduced into Bohemia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>But his Catholic training, strengthened by the
circumstances of his brother’s struggle against the
German Protestants, had produced in Ferdinand two
strong aspirations, which had been enormously
strengthened by the difficulties of the Turkish wars.
These were the desire for the consolidation of the
power of the Hapsburgs, by the union of the different
hereditary dominions of their House; and the desire
for union of the Church by the crushing down of the
various sects. These two objects were to be carried
out side by side, and each was to be brought into
prominence as opportunity occurred. It was to the
latter object that he first desired to address himself;
and certain circumstances had at this time specially
directed his attention to the Bohemian Brotherhood.</p>

<p>The peasant rising in Germany had produced great
dread of the teaching of the Anabaptists; and, after
the peasants had been crushed, many of this sect had
fled to Bohemia to escape persecution. The Brotherhood
had noticed that the new-comers agreed with
them on the question of the necessity of a second
baptism; and Lukas and other leaders of the
Brotherhood had desired, on this ground, to negotiate
further with the Anabaptists. A closer inspection
proved that no two bodies had less of spiritual sympathy
than the fiery revolutionists who followed
Thomas Münzer and the peaceable and orderly inheritors
of the traditions of Peter of Chelc̆ic. But
this negotiation had called unfriendly attention to the
proceedings of the Brothers; and the alarm which it
excited was further increased by the action of one of
those noblemen who had begun to patronise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
Brotherhood. This was Conrad of Krajek, the member
of a family who had defended the Brotherhood
against Ladislaus. Conrad had granted to the
Brotherhood a church on his estate, which had long
been left without a pastor, and the new clergyman
had removed from it the ornaments which the
Brothers considered idolatrous. Ferdinand demanded
the restoration of the ornaments, and Conrad refused
to obey. The Turkish wars hindered Ferdinand
from pressing his demand at this time; but Conrad
felt his danger, and resolved to take further steps for
the protection of the Brotherhood. He saw that the
German Protestants had greatly strengthened their
position by their recent publication of the Confession
of Augsburg; and it occurred to him that, if a similar
publicity were given to the doctrines of the Brotherhood,
they also might be placed in a better position
in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p class="caption">JOHN AUGUSTA.</p>

</div>

<p>The drawing up of this Confession brought into
prominence a man whose career was to have an
important influence, both on the history of the
Brotherhood and on the policy of Ferdinand. This
was John Augusta, the son of a hatter in Prague.
He had been born in 1500; and, though without any
regular learned education, he had acquired a useful
knowledge of Latin. He speedily made his mark in
the Society; and in 1532 he was admitted into the
smaller governing council. It was just at this time
that Conrad of Krajek had been convinced of the
need of a formal Confession of Faith for the Brotherhood;
and Augusta was appointed to undertake this
work. This document was not only intended for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
circulation among the immediate friends and acquaintances
of the Brotherhood; but it was also hoped
that it would attract the sympathies of the German
princes, and particularly of the Margrave of Brandenburg.
There was also another ally whom Augusta
was particularly anxious to win to the side of the
Brothers. Luther, as it will be remembered, had, in
the early period of his public career, made somewhat
eager advances towards the Utraquists; but, when the
treachery of Gallus Cahera had disgusted and repelled
him, he had turned for sympathy to the
Bohemian Brotherhood. Lukas and other leaders
had been well disposed to meet his advances; but,
on closer contact, they found three barriers apparently
insurpassable. The Brothers, like many other people,
had been startled and shocked by Luther’s doctrine
of Justification by Faith <i>alone</i>. They believed their
fears of this doctrine to be justified by personal observation;
for it seemed to be leading, in many cases,
to carelessness and even immorality of life, however
much it might seem to Luther to be the assertion of
a more spiritual creed against the belief in mere dead
works. Secondly, the Brotherhood came far nearer
to the Zwinglian doctrine of the Sacrament than
Luther could at all approve; and, thirdly, the same
ascetic tone which induced them to shrink from the
Lutheran laxity of life, made the Brothers unwilling
to accept a married priesthood. The contention had
become so sharp between Lukas and Luther, that
Luther, who showed himself the more moderate of
the two disputants, had felt it better to break off the
correspondence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>Nevertheless, there were many, both in the ranks of
the Brotherhood and of the German Protestants, who
desired a renewal of this intercourse; and, as Lukas
was now dead, there seemed less difficulty in beginning
a new correspondence. Augusta, therefore, went
to Wittenberg, and presented the Confession to
Luther. Luther seems throughout to have shown
a generosity and breadth of sympathy towards the
Brothers which were not always characteristic of
him. He readily praised a great part of the Confession;
he rejoiced in their agreement about the
main doctrines of Christianity and the rejection of
many Papal superstitions; and he declared that their
mistakes about the Sacraments and the question of
Faith and Works were to be attributed partly to
differences of language, and partly to a want of clear
perception on their part of the points at issue. With
regard to the married clergy, it soon became clear
that the difference between Luther and the Brothers
was not one of doctrine; but that it was due partly to
circumstances arising out of the persecution which
the Brotherhood had suffered, partly to a certain
ascetic tendency which inclined them to look upon
celibacy as the higher state. Luther therefore consented
readily and warmly to recommend the study
of the Confession to his friends; and a few years
later he even agreed that it should be printed and
published for them at Wittenberg.</p>

<p>Encouraged by Luther’s sympathy, both Krajek
and Augusta thought that the time had come for
presenting their Confession of Faith to Ferdinand
himself, and asking for a milder judgment than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
had at first been disposed to pass upon them. But
the temporary retirement of Soliman from Europe
had now left Ferdinand at liberty to carry out his
plans of uniformity. Although the Brotherhood had
now broken off their intercourse with the Anabaptists,
yet Ferdinand still remembered that attempt against
them; and he was even more embittered by the
recollection of Krajek’s disobedience. He therefore
not only refused to consider the Confession, but early
in 1535 he issued an order for the expulsion of the
Brothers from all the towns immediately dependent
on the king’s authority. The Utraquists eagerly
seconded the Catholics in this persecution; and the
towns of Vodnian, Klattov, and Taus (Domaz̆lic̆e) were
the first to carry out the order. The expelled Brothers
were also summoned before the royal Court in Prague
to answer for their offences. Amongst others, two
young lords of Janovic, who had been known as
patrons of the Brotherhood, were summoned to
Prague, and condemned to imprisonment in the
Black Tower of the Castle. A Brother named John
Zbornik, generally known as John the Hermit, was
summoned at the same time. Conrad of Krajek,
however, maintained that Zbornik was his serf, and
that the young lords of Janovic were not responsible
for him. Then Conrad was ordered to appear himself,
to answer for his interference with the law, and
at the same time to produce Zbornik. Conrad came
with Zbornik, and also with a large attendance of
knights and lords; but, in spite of their protests,
Zbornik was condemned without any regular trial,
and imprisoned in the Castle for three years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>Conrad did not yet abandon the cause; and he
persuaded Augusta to draw up an additional statement
of their Faith for presentation to Ferdinand.
In this copy the original Article about the Sacraments
was modified, so as not to offend the Lutherans; and
Luther himself expressed his approval of this second
document. Conrad now hastened to Vienna, to entreat
for the liberation of Zbornik and the young
lords of Janovic. He dwelt much on the illegality of
the proceedings connected with their imprisonment;
but Ferdinand maintained the most despotic principles
of authority, declared that he was only bound
to protect the Catholics and the Utraquists, and told
Krajek that the devil had led him to his present
faith. Krajek retorted that it was Christ, and not the
devil, who had led him there; and that, if Christ was
a “Picard,” then he (Conrad) was so too. Yet, in
spite of his defiant tone, Ferdinand seems to have
been impressed by Conrad’s protest; for, in the
following year, Zbornik and the young lords were
released from prison.</p>

<p>This release, however, was rather a concession to
the principle of legality than an abandonment by
Ferdinand of his plans for ecclesiastical uniformity;
and he fully hoped, by securing firmer support
amongst the Utraquists, to crush the extreme
Protestant sects. He had promised, at his coronation,
to support the Compacts of Basel; and, in
May, 1537, he appealed to the Bohemian Assembly
so to enforce the Compacts as to suppress those
sects who did not accept them. After a sharp discussion,
the representatives of the Brotherhood were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
persuaded to withdraw from the Assembly; but it
was soon found that the attempts at union had been
brought no nearer to their realisation by this exclusion.
Many of the Utraquists objected to the
Compacts of Basel, as an attempt to substitute a new
document for the words of Scripture. Others maintained
that the Catholic bishops had violated the
Compacts, and that they were still eager to suppress
the Utraquists. Though, therefore, the Catholics
and Utraquists agreed in hating the Brothers, they
were not able to combine their forces for their
suppression; and a new outbreak of the Turkish
war still further hindered the designs of Ferdinand.</p>

<p>In the meantime Augusta had been trying to
strengthen the union between the Brotherhood and
the foreign Protestants. He had visited Bucer and
Calvin at Geneva, had received a kindly welcome
from them, and had accepted many of Calvin’s doctrines
about Predestination. But his greatest hope
and his strongest personal sympathies were always
directed to Wittenberg; and his translation and
eulogy of a pamphlet written by Luther excited
Ferdinand’s indignant attention even during the
Turkish war. Threatened with arrest and imprisonment
in consequence of this publication, Augusta fled
once more to Wittenberg. There he was again
welcomed by Luther and Melancthon; and he complained
to them of the growing corruptions of the
Church in Bohemia, and of the increase of luxury,
even in the Brotherhood. Finally, he implored
Luther to interfere in these matters, and to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
a new system of church discipline in Bohemia. Some
suggestion of the kind had apparently been made
by other Bohemian exiles; but Luther was far too
wise to listen to the proposal. He had been willing
enough to discuss matters of doctrine with the
Brothers, and to welcome them as friends and allies;
but he had none of the national mania for Germanising
other countries; and he recognised to the full
the necessity for a variety of customs, and even for
modifications in the expression of doctrine. “Do
you,” He said to Augusta and his friends, “be the
Apostles of the Bohemians; I and mine will be the
Apostles of the Germans. Do you act according to
the opportunities presented to you, and so will we.”
If Joseph II., in the eighteenth century, had been half
as wise as Luther was in the sixteenth, the relations
of Germans and Bohemians to each other might even
now be considerably more friendly than they are.
After this interview Augusta returned to Bohemia,
and devoted himself, for the next year or two, partly
to a defence of the Brothers against the attacks of
the Utraquists, partly to an effort to restore the
Brotherhood itself to that simpler mode of life from
which it was drifting away.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the progress of Protestant doctrine
in Germany had produced considerable influence
on many of the old-fashioned Utraquists in Bohemia;
and they now offered fresh hindrances to Ferdinand’s
efforts after uniformity. Mistopol, the Administrator
of the Utraquist Consistory, and Mitmánek, a leading
preacher, had been particularly prominent in their
attacks on the Catholics; and when, in 1543, Ferdinand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
once more called together the Bohemian
Assembly, he found that his offer to enforce the
Compacts of Basel was met by a reaffirmation of
the Four Articles of Prague in their simplest and
extremest form. This roused him to great indignation;
and he now insisted on further restrictions,
both in ritual and preaching, and even forbade any
general meeting of the Utraquists, under penalty to
person and property. He insisted, however, that the
celebration of the anniversary of the death of Hus
should be maintained as one of the ordinary observances
of the Church. But Mistopol succeeded in
seizing the opportunity of this anniversary for a
violent sermon against the Catholics, which he
preached in the old Bethlehem chapel of Hus. For
this defiance Mistopol was summoned before the
Court of Prague; and though his sentence was
deferred for a time, Mitmánek, his chief supporter,
was banished from the country. The attempt to
conciliate the Utraquists having thus failed, Ferdinand
opened negotiations with the Pope, which were to
lead to the calling of the Council of Trent. Such
was the relation of parties to each other when, in
1546, the death of Luther removed the last hindrance
to the outbreak which was to change the conditions
both of Germany and Bohemia.</p>

<p>The formation of the Schmalkaldic League, in
1542, had already prepared the Protestants for collective
action; and the threatening attitude of Charles
V., coupled with the proposal for a Council, which
would undoubtedly condemn Protestantism, seemed
to many of the more eager spirits to justify immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
action. The Landgrave of Hesse and John
Frederick, Elector of Saxony, determined to anticipate
the attacks of Charles; and, not many months
after Luther’s death, they marched into Bavaria and
attacked the town of Ingolstadt. But, scarcely was
this step taken, when it was discovered that Charles
had provided against the attacks of his enemies, by
bringing to his side one of the most formidable of
them. Moritz of Saxony had been induced, by the
promise of his cousin’s lands, to desert the cause of
the Protestants, and to secure his new possession by
force of arms. Ferdinand hoped to reconcile the
Bohemians to Moritz by persuading him to renew a
former treaty of hereditary alliance between Saxony
and Bohemia.</p>

<p>But the Protestant feeling of Bohemia was too
strong to be juggled with in this manner; and, on
March 18, 1546, a League had already been formed
for the protection of the civil and religious liberties
of Bohemia. They even went so far as to appoint a
Committee of Eight, who were to manage the affairs
of the kingdom, and to raise arms and men without
asking the leave of the king. When, then, John
Frederick of Saxony suddenly entered Silesia, and
seized on the monastery of Dobrilug, Ferdinand found
that large numbers of the Bohemians refused to repel
this invasion of Bohemian territory; and even those
who went to the war were unwilling to fight. Though
Ferdinand at once sentenced to death the leading
mutineers, he could not hinder the citizens of Prague
from further negotiations with John Frederick. From
refusal to fight they rapidly passed into more active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
opposition; and at last they even enabled Caspar
Pflug to raise forces for the assistance of the Elector.</p>

<p>As the struggle went on, the enthusiasm of the
Bohemians rose; and on April 7, 1547, the fiercer
spirits of Prague suddenly seized the Town Council
Houses and bridges into their own hands, demanded
a safe-conduct for one of the men whom Ferdinand
had just condemned for mutiny, and insisted on the
imprisonment of one of Ferdinand’s Councillors, and
the recall to the Teyn Church of a preacher who had
been expelled for heresy. They even compelled
many of the Catholic leaders to give in their adherence
to the League; and all seemed ready for an
actual revolution. Suddenly, while the excitement
was still at its height, the news came that John
Frederick of Saxony had been completely overthrown
at the battle of Mühlberg. Instantly the more timid
of the conspirators deserted the League, and even
sent congratulations to Ferdinand on his victory.
But the fiercer spirits desired to fight it out; and, as
the troops of Ferdinand and Charles advanced upon
Prague, the citizens rang the alarm bell, and the
peasants flocked in with their flails from the neighbouring
villages, and repelled the first advance of the
royal forces. The Burgomasters and leading Councillors
had had no desire to resist the King; but they
were completely overborne by the fiercer citizens; and,
on the 6th of July, the anniversary of the death of Jan
Hus, an appeal was sent round to the nearest Circles,
calling on all the citizens to come to the defence of
Prague. Yet, in spite of this apparent vigour, there was
little real vitality in the movement; the leaders of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
League had hoped for the help of the Saxons; and
when that failed, they had had no desire to continue
the struggle. The men who had now undertaken the
defence were utterly unorganised, and without any
capable leaders. The first forces, who came in from
the neighbouring districts were defeated by the
troops of Charles; and, on the 8th of July, the city
consented to submit unconditionally to Ferdinand.</p>

<p>The first acts of Ferdinand on the recapture of
Prague were marked by an unexpected moderation.
Comparatively few of the conspirators were put to
death; the great bulk of them were let off with fines,
or the surrender of lands; and most of the liberties
of Bohemia were confirmed. But it was felt, nevertheless,
that all who had sympathised with the insurrection
were in a difficult and dangerous situation;
and the Utraquists, who had begun the movement,
combined with the Catholics, who had in many cases
yielded to it, to lay the whole guilt upon the Bohemian
Brotherhood.</p>

<p>The Bunzlau district had no doubt been conspicuous
in its refusal to send forces to the Saxon war.
Three or four of the lords, who were condemned for
their share in the insurrection, had been known for
their protection of the Brothers; and some of the
Elders of the Brotherhood had ordered a day for
prayer and fasting during the insurrection. It was
resolved, therefore, to seize this opportunity for crushing
this unpopular sect, and the chief suspicion was
directed against John Augusta. He had indeed protested
against the insurrection from the first, but it
was proved that he had come to Prague while it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
still going on; a visit to Liegnitz in Silesia was
also looked upon as suspicious; while undoubtedly
the chief charges against him were his known
influence in the Brotherhood and his connection with
Wittenberg. Even the lords who had hitherto been
favourable now disowned the accused; and the Captain
of Moravia, himself a member of the Society, told
Augusta that he ought to have prevented the
insurrection.</p>

<p>The Archduke Ferdinand was ordered to take
measures for carrying out the intended persecution;
and in the following year a Commission was appointed,
which reconstituted the Town Councils in various
districts, and ordered the new Councillors to proceed
rigorously against the Brothers. The chief persecution
began at Litomys̆l, where several men were
arrested for singing hymns at the funeral of a
Brother. On their refusal to abandon the Brotherhood
they were imprisoned in the White Tower of
the Castle of Prague; and, when threats and entreaties
were found to be of no avail, they were taken from
the tower and thrust into a hole into which the filth
from the castle discharged itself. After some months
of this treatment several of them gave way; but the
others remained firm, and were at last set free on
condition of withdrawing into Prussia.</p>

<p>During the early part of their imprisonment,
Augusta, from his place of concealment, continually
supplied them with money and letters of encouragement.
But the organisers of the persecution were
resolved, at all hazards, to make him their prisoner;
and one of the most active of them persuaded a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
leader of the Brotherhood to secure him a private
interview. Augusta had been taunted by some of the
prisoners with taking too much care for his own
safety, and he therefore resolved to risk the interview.
Instead of the man who had appointed it, three
others appeared, who at once arrested Augusta and
his secretary Bilek, and carried them off to the White
Tower of Prague. Thence he was speedily removed
to a wine-cellar, where he was chained hand and foot.
Soon after he was placed on the rack, and his side
was burnt with boiling pitch. The Archduke
Ferdinand himself doubted the legality of these proceedings;
but the King was rigorous in the enforcement
of his plans, and he wrote to his son suggesting
further means of torture. Augusta, he said, was not
to be allowed a moment for rest or sleep; and, as one
means for obtaining this end, an insect was to be
fastened near him which would worry him continually;
or, as another means of causing the same
misery, he might be allowed food, but never anything
to quench his thirst. But, before the letter containing
these barbarous instructions arrived, Augusta had been
removed from Prague to Kr̆ivoklát, where he seems
for a time to have fallen under a more humane gaoler.</p>

<p>Nor was the persecution directed solely against a
few leaders of the Society. In the same month in
which Augusta was arrested, a general Edict had been
issued for the expulsion of the Brotherhood and the
arrest of their clergy. As they were ordered to leave
Bohemia within six weeks, the Brothers in Litomys̆l
entreated that a longer time might be allowed for the
sake of the sick and of the women who were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
labour; and they pointed out that a similar relaxation
had been granted in the case of the Jews and
Anabaptists. This concession was, however, refused;
and the unfortunate people gathered together
at Rychnov to march over the Silesian hills. But
though the lords, who had formerly posed as patrons
of the Brothers, now deserted their cause and joined
in the persecution, help for the journey was, nevertheless,
provided by the richer members of the
Society; and the members of the Brotherhood, who
lived in those Silesian towns through which the exiles
passed, guided them securely through the dangers of
the hills; nay, even many of the Utraquists and
Catholics were so touched by their sufferings that they
joined in this assistance.</p>

<p>At last the procession entered Poland, and the
Brothers settled for a time in the town of Posen.
But, though many of the Polish nobles welcomed
them heartily, the Bishop of Posen stirred up the
King of Poland against them, and put them to
such inconveniences, that many of the Brotherhood
accepted the invitation of the Elector of Brandenburg
to settle in his newly conquered province of Prussia.
Not even in Prussia, however, were the troubles of
the exiles at an end. Mitmánek, the Utraquist
preacher who had been banished by Ferdinand,
excited the suspicions of the Elector of Brandenburg
against the new-comers, and even assured him that
the Confession which Augusta had taken to Luther
was not really the composition of the Brothers at all;
but that, in truth, they were Arians and Novatians.
An inquiry was set on foot into the real doctrines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
the Brotherhood; and, though the decision of the
inquisitors was mainly in favour of the Brothers, yet
the restrictions placed on them by the Elector were
so galling, and the pressure upon them to accept the
Confession of Augsburg was so persistent, that many
preferred to take their chance once more among their
Slavonic kinsmen of Poland, rather than to accept
the nominal protection of the Elector, when accompanied
with so many practical inconveniences.</p>

<p>Ferdinand’s schemes, for the unification both of
State and Church, seemed now ripe for further
development. With regard to the question of civil
government many difficulties had arisen during the
Turkish wars, from the claims for local privileges put
forward by various towns and districts of Bohemia.
When Ferdinand had required money for the
purposes of these wars, he had been forced to consider
not merely the constitutional rights of the
Assemblies of Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and the
Lausitz, but also the peculiar privileges of the district
of Loket, the miners’ rights in Joachims Thal
and Kutna Hora, and, above all, the extremely
anomalous position of the town and district of Eger
(Cheb), which had claimed, ever since the fourteenth
century, to be more nearly connected with the German
Empire than with the kingdom of Bohemia. And
even more embarrassing than any of these legal
privileges were the claims of the Assemblies of the
Districts or Circles. These were perhaps the most
important check, which still existed, on the power of
the king. As the nobles gradually sank into mere
courtiers, and as the towns became, in many instances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
specially dependent upon the King, that Order of
Knights, which had played so important a part in
the Utraquist struggles, found it more convenient to
deliberate in their own districts, where they held an
independent position, rather than in Prague, where
they might be outvoted by lords and citizens, and
overruled by officers of the King. These meetings
of the Circles were gradually gaining a kind of legal
authority; and, both in the Turkish and Saxon wars,
they had formed an important check on the action
of the Assembly at Prague, and had considerably
hampered the designs of Ferdinand. They had even
identified their interest at that time with the provincial
claims of Moravia and Silesia; and they had
maintained that an Assembly, composed only of
those Bohemians who met at Prague, could not
decide on so weighty a question as the war against
John Frederick. Ferdinand, therefore, had come to
look upon these Assemblies as his most dangerous
opponents; and, though he could not at once
suppress them completely, he contrived to limit their
powers and control their actions.</p>

<p>But Ferdinand had a special device of his own for
counteracting local independence and increasing the
royal power. This was the creation of a Chamber of
Finance, called in German “Hof-Kammer,” and in
Bohemian “Komora Dvorska.” This institution was
primarily introduced to meet the difficulties of the
King’s private income. During the reigns of Ladislaus
and Louis the royal lands had been heavily
burdened with debts; and Ferdinand’s relations with
the lords, to whom these estates had been mortgaged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
had made it difficult for him to ascertain the exact
state of the royal finances. The duty of the new
Court was to inquire into the condition of the king’s
Bohemian lands, and to base upon this inquiry an
annual statement of his needs. This statement was
to be followed by a demand from the various Assemblies
of the exact amount required. When this central
Chamber of Finance was supplemented by other
chambers of a similar kind in the different districts of
Bohemia, it was clear that an organisation had been
formed which might bring considerable increase to
the King’s power. The inquiry into the condition of
his finances would be accompanied by questions
about the inclination of each Assembly to concede the
money required; and thus questions of taxation would
be to a large extent settled before they had been submitted
to the lawful authority. Such a scheme,
however, could only come gradually into operation;
and it was during the reigns of Ferdinand’s successors
that the significance of the Hof-Kammer began
to be realised. In the meantime the King did not
forget to provide a more immediate security for the
stability of the House of Hapsburg; and, in 1549, the
Bohemian Assembly was persuaded to accept Maximilian
as the future King of Bohemia.</p>

<p>But the union of the Church was as much a part of
Ferdinand’s scheme as the centralisation of the royal
power; and Ferdinand supposed that since the
Catholics and Utraquists had united in persecuting
the Brotherhood, they would have no objection to
accept the same bishop as their spiritual ruler. But
again he was mistaken. The Utraquists were as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
determined as ever to assert their independence; and
they resented extremely the attempt to bring them
under the rule of the Catholic bishop. Indeed, so
strong was the opposition which was roused by this
proposal, that many of the Utraquists began to repent
of their persecution of the Brotherhood, and even to
show signs of sympathy with them.</p>

<p>Ferdinand at once sprang to the conclusion that
a new plot was on foot; and, with a suspiciousness
little short of insane, he assumed that Augusta must
be at the bottom of it. The torturers were sent down
to the prison at Kr̆ivoklát; and both Augusta and
his secretary were again stretched upon the rack. But,
when no conspiracy was discovered by this method,
Ferdinand had to look elsewhere for the source of
opposition to his wishes; and it was now for the first
time that he became conscious of a weak point in his
plans, which till then he had strangely overlooked.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, when Ladislaus was
trying to coerce the Brotherhood, he had failed to
obtain from the Moravian Estates that assent to his
wishes which the Bohemians had been willing to
grant. The consequence was that, while Ferdinand
had been so successful in expelling the Brotherhood
from his western province, the members of that society
had still met undisturbed in the province of Moravia.
A special circumstance had induced Ferdinand, for
the time, to overlook this evasion of his commands.
Wenceslaus of Ludanic, the Captain of Moravia, had
been a member of the Brotherhood; but he had
strongly opposed the revolt of 1547, had prevented
the Moravians from joining in it, and had even rebuked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
Augusta for not opposing it more actively.
Doubtless the loyalty of so influential a Brother had
had for a short time its effect on Ferdinand. But
the growing opposition which he encountered amongst
the Utraquists, and his increasing fears of the Brotherhood,
now led him to abandon this policy of compromise.
He called together the Moravian Assembly
at Brünn (Brno); and he ordered them, and especially
their Captain, to take steps for the immediate suppression
of the Brotherhood.</p>

<p>Ludanic answered by entreating Ferdinand not to
put down those who had attained to the knowledge
of the purified Gospel; and he assured the King that
Moravia would sooner perish in fire and ashes than
submit to violence in this matter. He then appealed
to the members of the Assembly; and the main
body of them confirmed his words in a loud voice.
Ferdinand then asked if any, there present, were
ready to obey him. Only seven members of the
Assembly responded to this appeal&mdash;five of them
lords and two knights. Then Ludanic once more
rose, and read to Ferdinand the oath which the King
had taken, as Margrave of Moravia, to defend the
liberties of that province. Ferdinand indignantly
answered that he had kept his oath, and intended to
keep it; upon which Ludanic explained that he had
not accused the King of having <i>yet</i> broken his oath;
but that he had read it to him as a reminder for future
use. Unable to accomplish his ends, Ferdinand was
at last obliged to dismiss the Assembly, and to retire
to his house. But, when he looked from his window
a little later, he saw the members of the Assembly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
carrying Ludanic home in triumph. Thus, while
crushed out in the province of Bohemia, the Bohemian
Brotherhood grew and flourished in Moravia.</p>

<p>About this time, the Brothers were enabled to renew
their correspondence with Augusta, by the help
of one of his gaolers whom they had succeeded in
bribing. Unfortunately, this correspondence did not
strengthen the friendly relations between the prisoner
and the Elders of the Society. Always of a rather
imperious disposition, and now embittered by his
sufferings, Augusta attempted to assert his authority
in a way which the Elders often resented. Indeed,
they had begun to think that the exclusion of
Augusta from the outer world disqualified him for his
office as Elder of the Brotherhood. They consented
indeed, in deference to his earnest appeals, to retain
him a little longer in his former dignity; and at one
time there seemed a hope that this painful dispute
might end in the release of the imprisoned Brother,
and his return to his former life. The second treachery
of Moritz of Saxony had overthrown the hopes of
the Imperialists; the treaty of Passau had raised
anew the Protestant expectations of religious liberty;
and in 1552 the Catholic and Protestant leaders of
the Moravian Assembly united in such an earnest
appeal for mercy to Ferdinand, that he consented to
consider the question of the release of his Protestant
prisoners.</p>

<p>But once more the tide turned against the unfortunate
Augusta. In February, 1553, his correspondence
with the Brotherhood was suddenly discovered.
Again Ferdinand was seized with an attack of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
conspiracy-mania; Augusta and Bilek were once more
hurried off to Prague, and chained together in the
White Tower. When no treasonable sense could by
any means be extorted from their letters, they were
allowed to return to their prison in Kr̆ivoklát; but all
further correspondence with the outer world was forbidden;
and the Elders of the Brotherhood, having
heard that Augusta had been put to death, elected a
new Elder in his place.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the hopes which had been raised by
the treaty of Passau were considerably strengthened
at this time, by the rumour, which was rapidly gaining
ground, that Maximilian, the future king of Bohemia,
was opposed to the policy of his father. Ernest of
Krajek, a member of that family which had already
offered such opposition to Ladislaus and Ferdinand,
eagerly welcomed back the Brothers to their old
quarters at Mláda Boleslav; and at the same time he
despatched a messenger to Vienna, to make sure of
the sympathies of Maximilian. This messenger was
John Blahoslav, a writer and artist, who was afterwards
to attain some celebrity as an historian of the
Brotherhood. When he arrived at Vienna he found
Maximilian in active sympathy with the Lutherans;
and he received much encouragement for the Brotherhood
from the preacher who had most influence with
the prince.</p>

<p>On the other hand, however, Blahoslav soon discovered
that a new power had sprung up in Europe,
more dangerous to the hopes of the Protestants than
any kings or generals. This was the Order of the
Jesuits, who had recently settled in Vienna, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
had gained great influence over the mind of Ferdinand.
That powerful body had soon directed their attention
to Bohemia; and, a few years after Blahoslav’s visit
to Vienna, they secured a settlement in Prague. Even
before that time, the persecution of the Brotherhood
had again been renewed. The death of Ernest of
Krajek gave Ferdinand an opportunity for venting
his hatred on the sons of his late opponent; and they
were forced, after a vain opposition, to close those
meeting-houses of the Brotherhood which their father
had re-opened. Blahoslav and other influential
Brothers were once more forced to hide themselves;
and many Protestants, who had been favourable to
them, were gradually persuaded to desert their cause.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was during this period of persecution
that the relations between Augusta and the
Brotherhood became once more severely strained.
He had succeeded in finding another messenger,
through whom he re-opened the correspondence with
his colleagues; and he sent the Elders some Commentaries
which he had just written upon the Gospels.
These he begged them to use as part of the teaching
of the Brotherhood. The Elders answered that they
had no time properly to examine the book; and
the bitterness caused by this ungracious answer
was further increased by their subsequent publication
of the book in a somewhat altered form. In
addition to these causes of disagreement, Augusta
now heard, for the first time, of his deposition from
the office of Elder; and, when he remonstrated with
the Brotherhood on the subject, they refused to reconsider
their decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>Whether Ferdinand heard of this controversy or
not, something prompted him at this time to renew
his efforts for the conversion of Augusta; and he
offered to release him on condition of his joining
either the Catholics or the Utraquists. To the first
of these proposals Augusta returned an unhesitating
refusal; to the suggestion of a reunion with the Utraquists
he gave at first a more evasive answer. When,
indeed, he was asked for a more definite statement,
he drew up a declaration of his firm adherence to the
Brotherhood; but an unexpected event prevented
him from sending off this declaration, and brought
about a change in his position, which was ultimately
to produce the most painful results.</p>

<p>Phillippina, the beautiful wife of the Archduke
Ferdinand, was anxious to act as a moderating
influence in the counsels of the family. She visited
Augusta in prison, and expressed a wish to serve him.
He eagerly asked that he and Bilek might be allowed
to spend Easter with their friends; and he mentioned
that they had been now about twelve years in prison,
and that he had not seen Bilek for eight years. Phillippina
succeeded in persuading King Ferdinand to yield
to this proposal; and both she and her husband hoped
that, by this means, they might pave the way for
Augusta’s conversion to the Catholic Faith. With
this view, after his Easter visit was over, he was sent
to a Jesuit convent in Prague. There, while well
treated in other respects, he was not allowed to see
any one but the chiefs of the Order; and they carried
on daily theological arguments with him. Their first
propositions they managed to state in so colourless a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
form, that he was forced to agree to them; but, when
they raised the question of the possibility of error in
the Church, they found that they and their intended
disciple were hopelessly at variance. Finding that
the Catholics had failed, the Utraquists now summoned
him before their Consistory, and tried to persuade
him to join their organisation. At first he
absolutely resisted their attempts; but he consented
at last to use expressions, which were afterwards
strangely perverted by some of his opponents. He
admitted that “he belonged to the Utraquistic
Bohemian Church, and that he agreed with them in
all those essential doctrines which they had derived
from Scripture.” These expressions were, very likely,
a greater concession to the Utraquists than he would
have made at a previous time; but it is abundantly
clear, from his subsequent action, that he did not
intend his words to imply the abandonment of any
doctrine which he had formerly held. Nor did the
authorities so consider them; for, though Bilek was
shortly afterwards set free, Augusta was sent back to
his prison at Kr̆ivoklát.</p>

<p>But the Elders of the Brotherhood chose to treat
these utterances as a complete abandonment of their
cause; and they wrote a fierce and taunting letter to
Augusta, in which they accused him of first attempting
to exercise Papal power over the Brotherhood, and
then abandoning them in order to obtain his release.
Even this injustice did not drive Augusta to abandon
his convictions. When, two years later, he was again
required to make submission to the Utraquists, he
refused to admit that he had held any heretical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
doctrines; nor would he accept the Utraquistic view
of the Sacraments; and, in 1563, he explicitly declared
that he believed the teaching of the Brotherhood to
be nearer to Holy Scripture than that of either the
Lutherans or the Utraquists. But the release, which
he would not obtain by concession, was shortly to be
granted to him gratuitously. In the year following
this declaration, Ferdinand felt that his end was
approaching; and, as if seized with remorse for his
injustice, he consented to set Augusta free, without
any further conditions. A few months later the king
died; and the accession of Maximilian produced a
further change in the fortunes of Bohemia.</p>

<h2>XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE DEATH OF FERDINAND I. TO THE
BEGINNING OF THE REACTION UNDER RUDOLF II.<br />
(1564-1600.)</span></h2>

<p>In describing a struggle between two rival powers
in a State, it is extremely difficult to give a correct
impression of the exact balance of success on either
side at a particular crisis in the controversy; and this
difficulty is enormously increased when the struggle
is concerned partly with the question of spiritual
(and therefore mainly individual) liberty; and
partly with the growth of those more material
forms of centralisation which check constitutional
freedom and local self-government. When we hear
of Ferdinand yielding on his deathbed to the prisoner
whom he had been trying for so many years to crush
into obedience, we feel that the victory lies, in the
main, with those spiritual forces which were working
against ecclesiastical uniformity. Nor does the resistance
of the Moravian Estates seem less important as
a victory of constitutional freedom, than the firmness
of Augusta as a security for spiritual independence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>But the real importance of such episodes as these
lies in the contrast which they offer to the main
tendencies of Bohemian history during the sixteenth
century; and the proof which they consequently give
of the survival of forces which seem elsewhere to be
crushed out. For centralisation was, after all, steadily
growing in the dominions of Ferdinand; and national
life, however it might struggle for existence, was
being sapped by arbitrary power.</p>

<p>Nor must we forget that there was one moral consideration
which worked on the side of Ferdinand.
The terrible danger to which Europe was exposed
by the Turkish invader was not really removed
until the latter part of the seventeenth century; and
even Vienna itself was to be once more endangered,
before the barbarian could be induced to settle down
peaceably beside his neighbours, and confine himself
to the oppression of his Christian subjects. When,
therefore, Ferdinand found that the local assemblies
of the different provinces grudged him their help in
this important struggle, and that even at Prague he
had difficulty in obtaining both money and soldiers,
it was not unnatural that he should feel a growing
indifference to liberties which seemed to him so
dangerous to the peace and order of Europe.</p>

<p>So when in 1555 he had summoned representatives
from all his dominions to meet at Vienna, to
devise a common scheme of action against the Turk,
he must have bitterly resented the absence of the
Bohemians, who refused to attend an Assembly where
they might be swamped by Germans and Hungarians.
An even more fatal point of opposition between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
National desire for peace and independence, and the
Imperial scheme for the defence of Europe, was found
in the question of military organisation. The old
privilege of the Bohemians, to refuse their services
for foreign wars, was continually insisted on by them
in opposition to Ferdinand; and he was almost unavoidably
compelled to raise armies which should be
independent of national sentiment, and to garrison
the frontier towns of Moravia with soldiers drawn
from all parts of his dominions.</p>

<p>Nor, while he was so successful in his schemes of
State centralisation, was Ferdinand wholly worsted
in his struggle for ecclesiastical unity. One victory at
least he gained; and by a curious irony of fortune, he
won it by granting a concession which had once been
most ardently desired by the Bohemian leaders, but
which had now, by change of circumstances, become
worse than useless. Just at the close of the Council
of Trent, he succeeded in obtaining from the Pope a
formal concession to the Bohemians of their right to
grant the Cup to the laity. Thus the old watchword
of the Hussite wars, separated from all that had given
it life and force, now became a step towards the
absorption of the Utraquists by the Catholics. When
once this concession was granted, Ferdinand insisted
that the Utraquists could no longer refuse to accept
the authority of the Roman Catholic Archbishop.
From this time forward, Utraquism ceases to be a
force in Bohemian history. Their separate Consistory
was indeed revived by Maximilian; and from time
to time the members of it continued to assert themselves
in the religious controversies of the day; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
every such effort tended more and more plainly to
show that the champions of the old faith were but
the impotent and unworthy representatives of traditions
of former greatness. With the death of
Ferdinand, all these questions enter on a new phase.
The strength and weakness of the late king’s ideals
were to be put to new tests during the reign of his
son.</p>

<p>Maximilian is one of those men who seem to the
careful student of history all the more pathetic,
because their failures are not of that striking and
dramatic kind which at once excite the sympathy of
the observer; but are rather gathered from a careful
comparison of the objects aimed at with those actually
accomplished. Hampered by the continual distrust
and the domineering influence of his father, half
inclined to the extremer doctrines of Protestantism,
and yet never able to shake off the recollection that
he was the heir of a Catholic tradition; angry
with the Jesuits for their intriguing interference
with his affairs, and no less angry with the Protestants
for those divisions which prevented a completely
artistic settlement of the ecclesiastical question;
anxious to recognise the local and other liberties of
his Bohemian subjects, but conscious of the difficulties
which those liberties placed in the way of the struggle
against the Turk, Maximilian was continually drifting
backwards and forwards in a way which tended to
weaken the system of government which his father
had tried to establish, without substituting anything
freer or more national in its place.</p>

<p>Nor must we forget that Maximilian had to deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
with the same insoluble problem for which Charles IV.
had only provided a temporary solution. Ferdinand
had reigned for nearly thirty years as King of Bohemia,
before he had been forced to assume the burden of
the German Empire. Maximilian had to take up
both these responsibilities at the same time; and,
apart from the enormous intellectual and moral
difference between Maximilian of Austria and
Charles of Luxemburg, the problem with which the
later Emperor had to deal was infinitely more complicated
than any which presented itself to the statesmen
of the fourteenth century. The difference between
Protestant and Catholic was in itself enough to introduce
years of division and war into the Empire; but
that element of confusion was now trebly increased
by the new sects into which Lutheranism had been
divided, and by the still keener political divisions
between the Lutherans and Calvinists. In Bohemia,
again, the same difficulties presented themselves in an
even more complicated form; for, while many of the
Bohemian Reformers had identified their cause with
that of the Lutherans, the old feeling of national distinction
was driving many into opposition to the
aggressive character of the German movement, and
compelling them to seek for a new religious centre
which should be neither Papal nor German. As the
Utraquists could no longer supply such a centre, the
championship of Bohemian feeling rapidly passed to
the leaders of the Bohemian Brotherhood. The great
defender of the national and distinctive position of
the Brotherhood, against the encroachments of the
Lutherans, was that Blahoslav who had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
become prominent as a negotiator with foreign
Protestants, and who was ultimately to become
the historian of the Brotherhood. He had already
vindicated the specially Bohemian character of the
Brotherhood against a critic who had tried to identify
them with the Franco-Italian sect of the Waldenses;
and so keen had Blahoslav and his friends been in the
assertion of their national position, that they had been
willing sometimes to speak of themselves as “the
remains of the Taborites,” choosing rather to identify
their cause with a Bohemian sect so different from
them both in spirit and doctrine, than with a French
or Italian community, however like them in every
respect but race.</p>

<p>When, then, the Lutherans demanded that the
Bohemian Brothers should accept the Augsburg
Confession, and practically consent to absorption in
the Lutheran body, Blahoslav and his friends resolved
to offer a steady resistance to this proposal.
Unfortunately, Blahoslav was forced to encounter, in
this controversy, the most distinguished member of
his own community. John Augusta, after his release
from prison, had been welcomed back to his friends
by the main body of the Brotherhood; but he soon
found that the power which he desired to exercise
over them was still resisted and resented. He proposed
that, instead of the free exercise of preaching
in the Brotherhood, certain definite parts of the
gospel should be chosen for exposition each Sunday
in the year; and he himself drew up a plan on which
these discourses should be founded. Some of the
Brothers objected that the doctrines suggested in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
book were not altogether those held by the Brothers;
while, no doubt, a still larger number resented the
restrictions which such an arrangement would impose
on the preachers. Irritated at the general opposition
offered to his proposals, Augusta came to the conclusion
that the Brotherhood was in a radically unsatisfactory
condition; and he threw himself into the
movement for union with the Lutherans, as a means
of reform. So bitter was the opposition which he
roused by this conduct, that he became entirely
separated from the rest of the Brotherhood; and,
when he died in 1572, his death passed almost unnoticed
by those for whom he had done and suffered
so much.</p>

<p>In the meantime Maximilian was endeavouring to
take up a neutral position in this controversy. Personally
in sympathy with the Brothers, but afraid of
offending Catholics and Lutherans, he continually
assured all parties that he was unable to assent to
any legal sanction for religious liberty, since he had
bound himself to oppose novelties; but that, if they
would only settle their differences between themselves,
nobody would interfere with the performance
of their religion. Even this statement was more
definite and consistent than his actual practice; for,
when the Catholic or Utraquist priests applied to him
for powers to suppress novelties or heresies, he assented
to their proposals, though, when either Brothers
or Lutherans complained to him, he assured them
of his personal sympathy for them, and his desire to
leave them untouched.</p>

<p>His great hope for the solution of these difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
seems to have lain in some scheme of union among
Protestants. If only the Lutheran sects, Bohemian
Brothers, and Calvinists would give up their quarrels
with one another, religious toleration would become
such an easy affair. He therefore sympathised particularly
with the new proposal, which was gradually
shaping itself in the discussions between the Lutherans
and the Brothers. This was a plan for a new Bohemian
creed, to be drawn up at a combined meeting
of the various sects. The Brothers looked upon this
movement with great suspicion. They saw in it an
attempt of the Lutherans to secure the acceptance
of the Augsburg Confession by indirect means; and
they noted their persistent attempts to exclude the
Brothers from those Assemblies where ecclesiastical
questions were discussed. Nevertheless, when Maximilian,
on his return to Bohemia in 1575, consented to
preside at the Assembly in which this new creed was
to be proposed, the Brothers were willing to take part
in the discussion. Doctor Crato, Maximilian’s physician,
secretly urged the Brothers to stand firm,
assuring them that the Emperor was really in sympathy
with them. Encouraged by this hint, they not
only resisted a motion for the acceptance of the
Augsburg Confession, but they even objected to the
appointment of a committee for the preparation of
formulæ which were to unite all parties.</p>

<p>The committee was, nevertheless, appointed, and
its actions soon justified the fears of the Brothers.
In the introduction to the proposed creed, the committee
pronounced an anathema against a number of
heretics, and, amongst others, against all Calvinists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
Now many of the Brothers had embraced Calvinistic
doctrines; and their friendship with the champions of
those doctrines had been strengthened by motives,
both of personal resentment and of moral sympathy.
The treatment of the exiled Brothers by the Lutherans
of Prussia had repelled the Brotherhood generally
from the creed of their unfriendly hosts; while the
strict moral discipline maintained in the Calvinistic
University of Heidelberg was more attractive to the
followers of Peter of Chelc̆ic than the growing laxity
of Wittenberg. They therefore offered a successful
opposition to that sweeping condemnation of Calvinism
to which the Lutherans desired to commit
them. But this was, after all, but a minor point in
the objections of the Brothers to the proposed creed.
Apart from every detail, the proposal to surrender
their own Confession in favour of any new form of
words whatsoever, was wholly inconsistent with the
position which they desired to maintain. They therefore
offered such steady resistance to the proposed
Confession, that they at last induced the Lutherans
to consent to a petition to the King and the
Assembly asking them to recognise each sect as a
separate organisation. This result, however, was not
reached till the controversy had become so fierce that
the rival theologians came to blows in the streets.</p>

<p>Maximilian was heartily disgusted with the whole
proceeding. He saw his hope of union among the
Bohemian Protestants annihilated. He felt that he
had injured his position with the Catholics by the
concessions which he had already made; and he was
further irritated that the Assembly should waste its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
time in these theological discussions, when he was
wanting it to consider the acceptance of his son
Rudolf as the future king of Bohemia, and to vote
money for the Turkish war. He laid the chief blame of
these failures upon the Brothers, who had resisted the
new Confession, and on the towns, which had always
made difficulties about the Turkish vote; and he sent
down orders to the governors to suppress the meetings
of the Brotherhood, and to forbid the towns to introduce
any novelties. He even went so far as to order
prosecutions of various Brothers for having attended
meetings forbidden by the law; but, before these
prosecutions could be carried out, this new policy was
suddenly cut short by the death of Maximilian in
1576.</p>

<p>Few kings had more thoroughly disappointed the
expectations formed of them than Maximilian II.
had done; but, in a different way, his son Rudolf
was to disappoint the hopes of the Catholics as completely
as his father had done those of the Protestants.
Brought up in Spain, and believed to be a strict
Catholic in convictions, shy and repellent in manner,
he seemed exactly the man to revive the reactionary
policy of his grandfather. But in Rudolf, as in the
majority of men, temperament and taste had a greater
influence over his actions than either religious or
political convictions. The same feelings which
made him so repellent in general intercourse, led
him also to shrink from the burdens of public life;
and his fondness for art and science led him in the
earlier part of his reign to leave politics to men of
more active character. The interest, therefore, of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
part of Rudolf’s reign, so far as his own influence is
concerned, centres rather in the revival of literature
and art, than in political or religious controversy.
This revival was of a varied character, for it included
not only poetry and history, but every kind of art and
science. Carving, statuary, and mosaic work were
brought to great perfection: while the presence of
Tycho Brahe at Court shows the interest which Rudolf
always maintained in astronomical science. The preference
of the new Emperor for Prague as a place
of residence naturally attracted all this brilliant company
to the Bohemian Court; and it seemed as if, in
this respect, the age of Charles IV. were to return.</p>

<p>At the same time, it should be noted that this
revival, though generally connected with the name
of Rudolf, had been already growing since the accession
of Ferdinand. The greater security for life and
property, which was gradually introduced by the
House of Austria, had given more opportunity for
quiet study than had been possible in the turbulent
Bohemia of the fifteenth century; while the greater
intercourse with foreign countries, which the renewed
connection with the Empire had produced, naturally
attracted a large number of foreign celebrities to the
Court of Prague.</p>

<p>The reign of Ferdinand had been marked by the
works of two most picturesque though untrustworthy
historians&mdash;Wenceslaus Hajek of Libocany, and
Dubravsky, better known as Dubravius, the Bishop
of Olmütz; while Matthæus Collinus of Choterina
called out an interest in the study of the great Greek
and Latin authors, who had till then been rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
neglected. The interest felt by Maximilian and Rudolf
in the revival of poetry was much keener than that
of Ferdinand; though they both, doubtless, stunted
more than one poetical intellect by the absurd practice
of turning poets into nobles, and crowning them
as Court Laureates. A more curious result of this
revival, considering the origin and sympathies of the
ruling House, was the steady development of the
Bohemian language during this period. Dictionaries
and other scientific works were produced; and Daniel
Adam, who was Professor of History at Prague in the
time of Maximilian, was said to have done much to
bring the language to great perfection. Nor did
Maximilian and Rudolf fail to encourage scientific
discovery. Thaddæus Hajek, who had studied, not
only at Prague, but also at Vienna and Bologna,
actually discovered a new star in 1572; and he showed
himself so far in advance of his age, that he used his
learning to expose and ridicule the astrological speculations
which were then so popular.</p>

<p>It might be expected, perhaps, that all this stirring
of thought and life would be favourable to the revival
of civic and religious liberty; and some of the men
who were eminent in the literature and art of the
time did take an active part in the struggles at
the beginning of the seventeenth century. But
a power had arisen in Bohemia, which continued
steadily to gain ground during the reign of Rudolf,
that could turn even literature and art into the
cause of opposition to reform. This was the Order
of the Jesuits, which, since the time of Ferdinand, had
been steadily gaining ground in Bohemia. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
eagerly seized upon the literary and artistic revival,
and made use of it for their own purposes. George
Bartold Pontanus, one of the poets who were crowned
by Rudolf, fell into the hands of the Jesuits, and became
one of their most eloquent preachers. William
of Rosenberg, who was a great patron of the Order,
founded an institution for poor scholars, which must
have greatly forwarded the Catholic reaction. Even
students of languages, and men engaged in foreign
discoveries, were made use of by the Order. Moreover
their great power then, as ever, was through the
education of children. Many of these came from the
poorest ranks, and were educated gratuitously by the
Jesuits; and, through them, an influence was prepared
which it was very difficult to resist. But the Jesuits
were intended by Ignatius Loyola to be, before everything,
a fighting body; and, as they looked round on
the forces opposed to them in Bohemia, they speedily
marked the Bohemian Brotherhood as the foemen
most worthy of their steel.</p>

<p>The Utraquists, as already mentioned, had been
reduced almost to impotence in the time of Ferdinand.
The Lutherans, divided among themselves, weak in
organisation, and without any hold on the feeling of
Bohemia, were almost equally an object of contempt
to the Jesuits; but in the Brotherhood they saw a
power of organisation, a capacity for intense self-devotion,
and great educational faculties, which made
them dangerous rivals even to the followers of Loyola.
Just at this time the Brothers had taken a step which,
while infinitely to their own credit, had yet raised up
against them enemies whom the Jesuits could easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
call in as their allies. The Brotherhood, as already
hinted, had found, even more than most religious
communities, a perpetual difficulty in solving that
painful problem of the proper relation of the Church
to the World; for, while they would never consent to
drift tamely into the conventional morality of a comfortable
and generally accepted Church, they were yet
continually forced to make concessions to the prejudices
of the world around them, which endangered
the spiritual life of their community. Their concessions
in the matter of war had, as we have seen,
driven from their ranks some of the stricter members
of the Society at a very early stage of their history;
and a difficulty which was an even greater vexation to
the minds of the Brothers, was the relation between
the Community and the nobles.</p>

<p>The original conception of the Brotherhood, as
a Society of equals working in the main with their
hands for their livelihood, had never been wholly
lost sight of; and the clergy were still expected to
support themselves largely by their own handiwork.
But the necessity for protection against the continual
outbursts of persecution from other sects had compelled
the Brothers to accept the patronage of certain
lords who were inclined to their doctrines. The most
zealous of these noblemen desired a closer union with
the Brotherhood than the position of outside patron
could give them; and yet they were by no means
willing to make that surrender of their rank and
position which the rules of the Brotherhood required.
The Brothers had not seen their way to exclude these
aristocratic members from an entrance into the Community;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
and the difficulties of the position naturally
increased, when the son or grandson of some zealous
nobleman accepted the hereditary connection with the
Brotherhood without any of the moral enthusiasm
which had led his ancestor to join it. The opposition
which the plebeian preachers of the Brotherhood
encountered in their attempts to exercise a spiritual
control over these aristocratic followers was of course
specially great in a century when even champions of
religious liberty claimed the right to dictate their
creed to their tenants and dependants. Serfdom, it
cannot too often be remembered, had gained a new
footing in Bohemia at the close of the fifteenth
century; and Krajek, in his championship of so
eminent a Brother as Augusta, had insisted much
on his right, as a feudal landlord, to protect his
dependant against the King. In such a condition of
society, it ought not to surprise us that the leaders
of the Brotherhood may have sometimes seemed to
wink at offences in the nobles which they condemned
severely in their more plebeian members.</p>

<p>But there was a recuperative force in this Community
which showed itself continually at critical
moments, and, in 1578, the Bohemian nobility were
startled by the news that the Brothers had expelled
from their Society, for acts of immorality, two members
of that very family of Krajek who had been the
steadiest patrons of the Brotherhood. A fierce outburst
of indignation and scorn followed; and the
Bohemian nobles asked how “Chlapi” (serfs), like
the leaders of the Brotherhood, could venture to deal
thus with the members of a noble family? Nor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
it only the protest of the nobles which showed how
far the ideal of the Brothers transcended that of the
rest of the Community. A Lutheran congregation at
once invited one of the expelled Brothers to join their
body, and urged upon him that such a step would
be a fit revenge on the ungrateful Brotherhood.</p>

<p>The Jesuits saw their opportunity in the sudden
unpopularity of the Brotherhood; and they pressed
upon several of the nobles to expel these revolutionary
heretics from their estates. The Chancellor, Vratislav
of Pernstein, was one of those to whom the Jesuits
made special advances; and they were able to influence
him not only through his prejudices as a
nobleman, but through his affection as a husband.
Pernstein, like so many of the Bohemian nobles
since their country had passed under the rule of the
Hapsburgs, had married a Spanish lady; and these
wives were, as a rule, zealous champions and obedient
pupils of the Jesuits. Frau von Pernstein had a special
influence, not only over her husband, but over many
of the younger Bohemian women; and, with her help,
the Jesuits succeeded in making many converts, even
in that town of Litomys̆l where Augusta had once
had so much influence. Both there and on other
parts of the estate Pernstein now proceeded to close
the meeting-houses of the Brothers, and he opened a
Jesuit college on the site of their former labours.
Adam of Neuhaus and William of Rosenberg
carried out the same policy on their estates, and
many other nobles followed their example. The
Bishop of Olmütz, Stanislaus Pavlavsky, now hoped
to rouse Rudolf to give active assistance to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
movement. At the bishop’s request, the Emperor
issued an order that no book should be sold in
Moravia without Pavlavsky’s special permission; and,
in order to secure the practical working of this prohibition,
he decreed that not more than two printing-presses
should be allowed at Olmütz.</p>

<p>At the same time a blow was aimed at the Brotherhood
in a still more important part of their work.
Ezrom Rüdiger, a leading Brother, had opened
a school at Ivanc̆ic̆e, which had gained so high a
reputation that men of other denominations sent
their children to be taught by Rüdiger, and the
managers of a rival Lutheran school in the city of
Velké Mezir̆íc̆í attempted to decoy Rüdiger away by
the offering of a higher salary. Of course these
bribes had failed of their effect, and a decree had
been obtained by the Jesuits for the closing of both
these schools. This order, however, had been disregarded;
and Rüdiger had gained further reputation
by defending the Brotherhood against the attacks of
the leader of another sect. This controversy, however,
gave a handle to the Bishop of Olmütz, and
he denounced both Rüdiger and his opponent to
Rudolf as disturbers of the peace. A warrant was
sent down for the arrest of Rüdiger, and about the
same time Herr von Pernstein imprisoned two of the
Brothers on his own Moravian estates.</p>

<p>But now, as in the time of Ferdinand, attempts at
persecution, which had succeeded in Bohemia, broke
down before the opposition of the Moravian Estates.
At the meeting of the Moravian Assembly, the
Bishop of Olmütz was so roughly treated by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
colleagues, that he left Brünn before the meeting
was over. The two clergy on the Pernstein lands
were released. Rüdiger, who had taken refuge with
Frederick of Z̆erotin, was allowed to submit his case
to the Moravian Estates; and the Assembly not
only disregarded the Edict about the books and the
printing, but passed a vote of censure on those who
had made attacks on the Brotherhood. This and
other failures soon persuaded the leaders of the
Catholic reaction that they had little hope of support
from the Emperor; and the Jesuits were forced to
carry on their struggles through the help of individual
noblemen.</p>

<p>But, in 1592, even this form of propagandism
encountered an unexpected obstacle. In that year
William of Rosenberg died, and his nephew, Peter
Vok von Rosenberg, succeeded to the estates. He
had gained some distinction as a soldier under Ferdinand
and Maximilian; but soon after Maximilian’s
death he had married Caterina of Ludanic, a member
of the family of that Wenceslaus of Ludanic
who had defended the rights of the Brotherhood and
the liberties of Moravia against Ferdinand. Under
her influence Peter Vok rapidly drifted to Calvinism;
and in 1582 he had formally joined the Brotherhood.
On coming into his estates he soon gave signs of his
change of creed; and, as a first step, he so harassed
the Jesuits of the college which his uncle had founded
at Krumov, that they left that town and fled to
Neuhaus. About the same time, George of Lobkovic,
another champion of the Jesuits, was deprived
of his office by Rudolf for fraudulent use of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
power; and, his estates being forfeited to the Crown,
Rudolf handed them over to a man whom he supposed
to be a zealous Catholic, but who soon proved
to be a friend and favourer of the Lutherans. Thus,
then, a general struggle was going on throughout
Bohemia, which, from the apparent indifference of
the Emperor, was tending more and more to loosen
the bonds of the central government, and was in
many cases leading to open acts of violence and
disorder. But, just as the sixteenth century was
closing on this condition of things, a series of events
occurred which roused the Emperor from his lethargy,
and produced a complete change in the course of
Bohemian history.</p>

<h2>XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE REACTION TO THE
DEATH OF RUDOLF II.<br />
(1600-1612.)</span></h2>

<p>However indifferent Rudolf might have seemed
to his duties as King of Bohemia, he was as anxious
as most of his predecessors had been to maintain
his ground in Hungary both against Turks and
rebels. And during the closing years of the sixteenth
century he had gained new hopes of success in the
struggle, from the submission which was at last offered
to him by the Prince of Transylvania. Unfortunately,
however, for Rudolf, the cruelty of his general,
Basta, produced such disorders in the newly conquered
province, that the Transylvanians rose against the
Emperor, joined themselves to the discontented
nobles of Hungary, and once more called in the
Turks, who gained several victories over the Imperial
forces. Rudolf, like his predecessors, had been
irritated at the opposition which had been offered
by the various Assemblies of the Bohemian kingdom
to his continual demands for money for the Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
war; and this opposition had been greatly increased
by his attempt to extend the powers of that Hof-Kammer
which had been instituted by Ferdinand.
That body, no longer contented with inquiring into
the debts and credits of the king, now wished to pry
into the incomes of his subjects, and even to make
its own arrangements for the collecting of taxes.
These encroachments were naturally resented by the
Bohemians; and the continual friction thus produced
roused Rudolf to more energetic action.</p>

<p>Nor were the differences with his subjects and
the danger from the Turk the only causes of this
apparent change of disposition in the sluggish
Emperor. The Austrian Archdukes had noticed the
growing disorders in Bohemia, as well as the neglect
by Rudolf of the affairs of the Empire; and, on
further inquiries, they found evidence that much of
this neglect was due to the strange state of mind into
which the Emperor was falling. That shy and melancholy
disposition which had led him, in the early part
of his reign, to withdraw so much from public life, was
now ripening into a condition of morbid suspicion
which had in it a strong taint of insanity. It is a curious
sign of the extent to which superstition affected even
great minds in the sixteenth century, that this tendency
in Rudolf was largely encouraged by a prophecy
of the great Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe.
The recent murder of Henry III. of France by the
monk, Jacques Clément, had impressed the imagination
both of the Emperor and the astronomer; and
the latter had prophesied that the same fate which
had overtaken the French king also awaited Rudolf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
This prophecy had increased the Emperor’s tendency
to morbid suspicion, and had led him still further to
withdraw from the public gaze. The Archdukes now
inclined to believe that the only hope for good
government was in the removal of Rudolf from
power, and the substitution of his brother Matthias
on the thrones of Bohemia and Hungary and Austria.
Rudolf resented this proposal with all the fierceness
of a half crazy man; and this interference of his
brothers, combined with the advance of the Turks
into Hungary, determined him to adopt a new policy.</p>

<p>Both in Hungary and Bohemia he saw, or believed,
that the Protestants were the main cause of the opposition
to his power. He knew that in the kingdom of
Bohemia they had continually resisted his decrees;
and he believed them to be the prime movers of
the Hungarian insurrections. Therefore, in 1602,
he suddenly revived the old decree of Ladislaus
which commanded the suppression of all sects
in Bohemia. In pursuance of this decree, the chief
meeting-house of the Bohemian Brotherhood in Mláda
Boleslav was closed; and Cardinal Dietrichstein began
a regular persecution of the Protestants.</p>

<p>In 1604 the same policy was extended to Hungary;
and when the Hungarians endeavoured to protest,
Rudolf issued a decree that all who tried to bring
forward religious grievances in the Hungarian
Assembly should be treated as disorderly persons.
Thereupon the Hungarians rose in insurrection, and
chose as their leader Stephen Bocksay, a Transylvanian
nobleman. Rudolf’s inability to provide payment
for his troops soon produced a mutiny among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
them; Bocksay succeeded, not only in conquering
Transylvania, but in overrunning Hungary, and at
last entering Moravia. Bocksay had hoped to persuade
the Moravian Estates to join him in defending
the cause of civil and religious liberty. This the
Moravians were unwilling to do, as they hoped to
come to terms with Rudolf. But the unpopularity of
Cardinal Dietrichstein, and the cruelties of Rudolf’s
German troops, gradually weakened the sympathies
of the Moravians for their king; and in the general
state of misery and confusion which followed, two
movements began to be developed for the counteraction
of Rudolf’s policy&mdash;movements widely different
in character and methods, but both intended to promote
the cause of civil and religious liberty&mdash;and each of
them finding its ablest and most earnest supporter in
a member of the Bohemian Brotherhood.</p>

<p>Of these the first to ripen into action was the movement
which had its centre in Moravia, and its best and
ablest champion in Charles of Z̆erotin. The life of this
nobleman was a striking illustration of that effort after
compromise, which has already been spoken of as so
characteristic of the Brotherhood&mdash;an effort which
makes it so interesting to the student of human
nature, and which enabled it to gain so great an
influence in the history of its country; though it
produced a somewhat disappointing effect, if one
looks to the Brotherhood for the highest embodiment
of Christian life.</p>

</div>

<p>The Z̆erotin family had long been established in
Moravia, and had had many claims to distinction,
especially on the battlefield. They had eagerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
adopted the cause of Hus, and boasted that, since
that time, they had never had a Roman Catholic in
their family. They had accepted the principles of the
Brotherhood, so far as they were consistent with noble
rank and the military profession; and John of Z̆erotin,
the father of Charles, had played as prominent a part
in Moravia, in the character of protector of the poorer
Brothers, as Conrad of Krajek had played in Bohemia.
He had fallen under the influence of Blahoslav, and
had imbibed something of his zeal for learning and
his keenly patriotic feelings. Charles had been sent, as
a boy, to study at Strasburg, Basel, and Geneva; and
his interest in the foreign Protestant communities had
led him to desire that they should unite to resist the
encroachments of Rome and Spain. He submitted
strictly to the rules of the Brotherhood in the choice
of a wife, not venturing to ask in marriage the lady
whom he had chosen, till he had consulted the bishop
and other leading members of the Brotherhood. In
his zeal for resistance to the power of Spain, he assisted
Henry of Navarre in his war against the Catholic
League. But his disgust at the profligacy of Henry’s
court ripened into absolute disapproval of the cause,
when Henry was received back into the Catholic
Church. Soon after this event Z̆erotin took service
under the Archduke Matthias in the war against the
Turks; and thus he gained the favour of Rudolf,
and obtained an appointment in the Land Court of
Moravia. Here he soon found that Cardinal Dietrichstein
and Ladislaus of Berka were making great efforts
to strengthen the power of the Jesuits in Moravia,
and to weaken the influence of the Protestants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
Just at the time when Charles of Z̆erotin began to
devote himself to the local government of Moravia,
Charles of Lichtenstein, a member of an old Protestant
family of Moravia, was converted to the Catholic faith;
and soon after this Dietrichstein was chosen Bishop of
Olmütz.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the last Bishop had made
ineffectual attempts to suppress the freedom of the
press, and to crush out Protestantism. But Dietrichstein
was so far from being warned by this failure that
he speedily set himself to restore a clause in the oath
administered to the officials in the Land Court, which
recognised as necessary the worship of the Virgin and
the Saints. Z̆erotin soon became recognised as the
opponent of the new Bishop; and once again comes
to the front the ever-reviving question of the Bohemian
language. Dietrichstein had been brought up in Spain,
and spoke Spanish by preference; and though he
could on occasion speak German, he had very little
knowledge of Bohemian. Z̆erotin declared that if
Dietrichstein was to be allowed to take his seat in
the Land Court of Moravia, he must speak the
language of that country; and the Cardinal in vain
attempted to overrule this decision, and to obtain a
hearing in German.</p>

<p>This struggle took place at the time when Rudolf
was gradually resolving on a more oppressive policy;
and Dietrichstein succeeded in bringing against Z̆erotin
charges of treason, which induced the Emperor to
summon him to Prague. His support of Henry IV.,
whom Rudolf considered his enemy; his sympathy
with the Count Palatine of the Rhine, who was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
suspected of aiming at the Bohemian crown; and his
refusal, in deference to the religious principles of the
Brotherhood, to drink the Emperor’s health at a
banquet, were all brought forward by Dietrichstein
in proof of the charge; and the evident sympathy of
the Moravian Estates for Z̆erotin was not likely to
make him more welcome to the Emperor. When,
indeed, Z̆erotin was tried for these offences in 1601,
he was acquitted on all the charges against him; but
when Rudolf revived the enactment of Ladislaus
against the sects, Z̆erotin was deprived of his office.</p>

<p>He now, for a time, retired from public life, and
devoted himself to the study of theology and the
education of young noblemen. But his study of
Calvinism, and his continual correspondence with
those who still maintained their interest in politics,
prepared him for a return to public life. At the time
of the invasion of Bocksay, Z̆erotin’s sympathies had
been somewhat divided. He was, of course, zealous
for religious freedom; and he had a warm personal
friendship for Stephen Illyezhazy, a leading Hungarian
Protestant, who had great influence in Bocksay’s
councils; but, on the other hand, he must have
strongly disliked the Turkish alliance; and he had
a great personal loyalty to the House of Hapsburg.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the hopes of Z̆erotin
were more and more directed to the proposal for putting
forward Matthias in the place of Rudolf. This
arrangement would secure the crown of Bohemia to
the House of Hapsburg, and would gain for the
oppressed Protestants a leader who might protect
them at once against Rudolf and against the Turk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
Z̆erotin’s Hungarian friend, Illyezhazy, was willing to
accept this policy; and even Lichtenstein, though a
Catholic, consented to act with the Protestant leaders
in their championship of the candidature of Matthias.
As Rudolf still resisted any proposal for compromise,
the Archdukes decided to give power to Matthias to
act as their chief in Hungary and elsewhere; and he
succeeded in making peace with Bocksay, by granting
to the Hungarians full religious freedom and the
election of their own Palatine. Rudolf, however,
though he had been compelled to recognise Matthias
as his general in Hungary, refused to consent to the
terms of peace; and the miseries of Moravia were
increased by the cruelties of the troops sent to protect
them, by the difficulties which Dietrichstein and
Berka threw in the way of order, and by the unwillingness
of Rudolf to take any decided action of a useful
character.</p>

<p>At last, therefore, in December, 1607, a meeting took
place at Z̆erotin’s castle in Rosice, to which he invited,
not only his Moravian friends, but also the Hungarian
Illyezhazy, and the leader of the Protestants in Upper
Austria, George Erasmus von Tschernembl. They
resolved to insist on the enforcement of the terms
of peace in Hungary; and they demanded that the
princes of the Empire should compel Rudolf to confirm
the concessions of Matthias. Rudolf became alarmed,
and prepared to suppress the movement by force of
arms. Ladislaus von Berka persuaded the forces of
General Tilly to come secretly into Moravia and concentrate
themselves near Brünn (Brno). On March 7, 1608,
the Land Court of Moravia held its sittings; and, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
the night before its meetings, Tilly’s troops were secretly
introduced into the town. The champions of Moravian
liberty were, however, on the watch; and, when the
Land Court assembled, Carl von Lichtenstein suddenly
entered it, at the head of sixty armed men, informed
Berka of the introduction of the foreign soldiers, and
demanded that, before they proceeded to further
business, the Moravian nobles should take into consideration
the defence of their country. Berka
declared that there was no danger, and demanded
that they should proceed to the ordinary business
of the court; whereupon Lichtenstein and his friends
denounced Berka as a traitor, drove him from the
court, and sent fifty of the young nobles to guard the
streets against the foreign troops.</p>

<p>But the old rivalry between the nobles and the towns
suddenly showed itself at this crisis. The Town
Council of Brünn refused to support the lords in
their action; and, when the lords adjourned to
Ivanc̆ic̆e, the leading Moravian towns refused
to send representatives to their discussions. Rudolf
now summoned to Brünn the regular Assembly of the
Moravian Estates; but he forbade them to consider
any propositions, except those which should be laid
before them by the royal Commissioners. Z̆erotin,
however, protested so strongly against this limitation,
that the commissioners left Brünn without being able
to get their propositions considered.</p>

<p>Z̆erotin now looked about for further allies in the
struggle, and thereby became aware of the very different
schemes which were being formed against the power
of Rudolf. The Brotherhood had already shown an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
inclination to an alliance with the German Calvinistic
princes, and particularly with the Elector Palatine of
the Rhine; and they had excited some alarm, in
1577, by consenting to send representatives to a
meeting of the Calvinists at Heidelberg. Z̆erotin
had maintained a personal friendship with the Elector
Palatine; but the policy of that Court was now being
largely guided and controlled by a prince of another
house, whose zeal for religious liberty was mixed with
motives of a very different character. This was
Christian, Prince of Anhalt, the most prominent and
active of the Calvinistic leaders of Germany, whose
restless personal ambition seemed almost to overshadow
his zeal for Protestantism; and who
might be considered one of the chief causes of the
ruin of Bohemian independence and the miseries of
the Thirty Years War. His great aim was to overthrow
the House of Hapsburg; and he would have
been willing, for that purpose, to absorb Bohemia and
Hungary in the German Empire. Z̆erotin, though at
first willing to negotiate with Christian as the leader
of the German Protestants, soon found that his aims
and those of that prince were totally opposed. For
the present, however, everything was subordinated to
the determination of the champions of constitutional
liberty to combine against Rudolf.</p>

<p>The meeting took place at Ivanc̆ic̆e, in spite of
the opposition of the Emperor and Berka. Berka
was deprived of his captaincy; a provisional government
was established; and Charles of Lichtenstein
was called upon to act as provisional Dictator. In
proposing Lichtenstein, Z̆erotin was actuated partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
by political, partly by religious, considerations. As
a statesman, Z̆erotin felt that it was necessary to win
the support of men of all creeds, by putting the
question of orderly constitutional government before
the question of religious liberty; and he therefore
preferred the choice of a Roman Catholic leader.
But this political instinct was strengthened by a
religious scruple, which showed the strong hold that
the doctrine of the Brotherhood still maintained over
Z̆erotin. He was still convinced that war in defence
of his country or of constitutional government might
be justified; but, as a follower of Peter of Chelc̆ic̆, he
could not admit that it was lawful to stain the cause
of religious liberty by the shedding of blood. This
scruple, however, did not diminish his sense of the
necessity of vigorous action. The leaders of the
meeting at Ivanc̆ic̆e resisted Rudolf’s attempts
to disperse them, commanded Tilly to leave the
country, and succeeded in rousing such a feeling
among the Moravians of the poorer towns, that the
Town Councils were overborne; and, with the exception
of Olmütz, all the towns declared themselves on
the constitutional side. Finally, the Assembly sent
an invitation to Matthias, to ask him to undertake
the government; and they hastened to Znojem to
greet him on his arrival.</p>

<p>But, although Z̆erotin had succeeded in effecting
an alliance between Moravia, Hungary, and Austria,
he had not yet succeeded in winning to his side the
leaders of the Bohemian Assembly; and it was in his
attempts to form this union that he was encountered
by the opposition of another member of the Brotherhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
who followed a tradition somewhat different from
Z̆erotin’s. This was Wenceslaus Budovĕc of Budova,
a leader among the Knights in the Assembly. He,
like Z̆erotin, had studied much in foreign countries,
and had gained such favour with Rudolf, that he had
obtained a place on his Council. He soon became
prominent in the Assembly; and, on the issue of
Rudolf’s new decree against the Protestants, he led
the opposition to it in the Assembly. He was unwilling,
however, to proceed to any extreme measures
at first; and he even consented to vote the tax
demanded by Rudolf, without making the repeal of
the decree a condition precedent to the vote. He
pointed out that, since the setting aside of the
Compacts of Basel, there was no further pretence
for saying that the Utraquists were the only non-Catholics
who were entitled to toleration. He dwelt
on the services done by the Brotherhood in the
Turkish war; and he succeeded in carrying a petition
for the repeal of the decree; but before the
petition could be presented, Rudolf dissolved the
Assembly, and summoned Budovĕc before him.
Budovĕc maintained that he had only exercised his
lawful privilege as a Bohemian knight; and Rudolf
thought it better to dismiss him for a time.</p>

<p>Budovĕc now entered into friendly relations with
Z̆erotin; but, when the latter urged him to support
the candidature of Matthias, Budovĕc maintained
that it was more advisable to appeal again to Rudolf.
His reasons may be easily imagined. Matthias, like
Rudolf, was a Roman Catholic; and his chief adviser
was Khlesl, Bishop of Vienna, who was by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
inclined to measures of toleration. It was true that
Matthias had granted liberties to the Protestants of
Hungary; but it was by no means certain that, if he
were suffered to dictate his terms to Bohemia and
Moravia at the point of the sword, backed by the
whole support of his family, he might <i>then</i> grant
equal liberties to <i>them</i>. Budovĕc therefore preferred
to see what the Protestants could gain from Rudolf
when under the fear of Matthias’s advance, rather
than to trust to what Matthias would do if he came
as a conqueror. When, then, Matthias, at the head
of a Moravian, Austrian, and Hungarian army,
marched into Bohemia, Budovĕc and his friends
declared their willingness to stand by Rudolf.</p>

<p>When, on May 19, 1608, Rudolf, for the first time for
many years, met the Assembly of Bohemia, Budovĕc
at once demanded that, as Rudolf had already made
concessions to the Protestants of Hungary, he should
now grant the liberties required by the Protestants
of Bohemia. The Bohemian Confession of 1575 was
to be recognised. Defenders were to be chosen to
protect the interests of the Protestants. Offices were
to be granted in equal proportion to Protestants and
Catholics. No foreigners were to be allowed to
manage Bohemian affairs. And, above all, no one
<i>of any rank</i> was to be interfered with in matters of
religious liberty. The importance of this last clause
is not perhaps easy to realise in our time; for, in
fact, this is one of the very first assertions of the
rights of <i>all</i> men to religious liberty. Although it is
probable that expressions may have been often used
which, if logically interpreted, would have involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
principles of the most complete spiritual independence,
yet both in Germany and Bohemia the maxim
“Cujus regio ejus religio,” had always been accepted
as the legal and natural rule in religious affairs.</p>

<p>In Bohemia, as already mentioned, the condition
of the peasantry had become more dependent during
the 16th century; and, in 1585, the Estates had distinctly
forbidden servants to leave their masters for
the purpose of entering trades, unless with the
written permission of those masters. The struggle
described above, in the earlier years of Rudolf’s
reign, had been mainly a struggle between landed
proprietors; and even a lady, who professed allegiance
to the Brotherhood, had so far misunderstood
their doctrines as to drive a Utraquist preacher from
her estates, and to compel her peasantry to attend
the sermons of a member of the Brotherhood. The
principle, therefore, which Budovĕc asserted, was
emphatically a new one; and he connected it, as
will be seen, with appeals to the national feeling of
Bohemia.</p>

<p>Besides the revival of the old and often repeated
claim for the exclusion of foreigners from Bohemian
offices, the petitioners emphasised their national
position by a reference to the memories of their last
national king. They demanded that the sword and
crown which had been taken from the statue of King
George, in the Teyn Church, should at once be
restored to it. On this point alone Rudolf yielded.
To the other demands he refused to give an immediate
answer. Yet even this failure could not at
once induce the Bohemian Estates to abandon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
cause of Rudolf for that of a prince who was invading
Bohemia at the head of a Hungarian army. This
feeling was shared by the peasantry of Bohemia; and
several collisions took place between them and the
soldiers of Matthias.</p>

<p>But, though Matthias could not succeed in the
conquest of Bohemia, Rudolf, on his part, was unable
to defend or recover the rest of his hereditary
dominions; nor is it probable that Budovĕc and his
friends were at all prepared to engage in a war
against their fellow-Protestants in Moravia, Hungary,
and Austria. Rudolf, therefore, after vainly attempting
a compromise, consented to renounce Hungary
and Austria in favour of Matthias, and to allow him
to administer Moravia during his lifetime. Matthias
thereupon evacuated Bohemia; but Rudolf’s resistance
was not yet at an end. He resented bitterly
both the loss of his territories and the demands of
the Bohemian Protestants; and, as he was not yet
able to take any steps to recover his lost lands, he
proceeded to turn his bitterness against Budovĕc and
his allies.</p>

<p>In this course he was encouraged by three
councillors, who were to play a memorable part in
the history of Bohemia&mdash;the Chancellor Lobkovic
and the ministers Slavata and Martinic. The first
proposal of the Emperor was not merely to reject the
petition of the Protestants, but to treat their agreement
to stand by each other as a conspiracy; and he
demanded that the document which contained the
agreement should be handed to him to be destroyed.
The Protestants chose a Committee of Twelve to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
remonstrate with Rudolf on this demand; and at the
head of that committee they placed a man who was
to become only too well known in Bohemian history,
Count Matthias of Thurn. They waited on the King
with the document for which he had asked, but told
him that they had only produced it that he might
know the names of his faithful subjects. Rudolf
seems, for the moment, to have been impressed with
this protest, and consented not to destroy the petition.</p>

<p>Budovĕc, however, and his friends were determined
on using their opportunity to the utmost; and they
were all the more eager in their pressure, because
they found that the official leader of the Assembly,
Adam of Sternberg, was entirely out of sympathy
with their efforts, and that he was continually endeavouring,
on the one hand, to make divisions
between the Utraquists, the Lutherans, and the
Brotherhood; while, on the other hand, he represented
the Assembly to the Emperor as really willing to
accept as satisfactory the offers which they in reality
repudiated. The difficulties, which might have arisen
from this latter part of Sternberg’s policy, were
obviated by the attitude of uncompromising resistance
which was taken up by Lobkovic, Slavata,
and Martinic. At last, on the advice of these
councillors, Rudolf decided to dissolve the Assembly.
Then Budovĕc saw that the time for constitutional
agitation was nearly over; and on April 1, 1609, he
gathered his friends together, and gave notice to the
chief Burggraf of Prague that they were resolved
to use force to resist all injustice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>Although they were now obviously compelled to
accept, in some respects, that leadership of Matthias
which they had previously opposed, the Bohemian
Protestants were not yet prepared to rely wholly on
the King of Hungary. The Estates of Silesia and
Lausitz, though largely in sympathy with the Protestant
movement, had agreed with the Bohemians,
in the previous year, in refusing to repudiate Rudolf.
The Silesians were now ready to follow the Bohemians
in their more determined policy; and the Bohemians,
on their part, were disposed to strengthen this alliance,
by granting to Silesia that position of independent
equality which they had hitherto refused. A
league was therefore formed between the Bohemian
and Silesian Assemblies, of such a kind as might
have been agreed upon between two independent
Powers; and the Silesians were ready enough to
co-operate under these circumstances.</p>

<p>But it was not only on their immediate neighbours
that the Bohemians relied. They appealed also to
the Protestant princes of Germany, both Lutheran
and Calvinistic; and from them, too, they received
encouraging answers. It was now evident that both
sides were within a measurable distance of war; but
it was also clear that Rudolf might still have a chance
of preventing the insurrection from actually breaking
out, by dividing the forces of his opponents, and depriving
the movement of any legal centre. For
greater security, the Assembly were now meeting in
the Council House of the New Town of Prague; and
Rudolf, therefore, ordered the Councillors of that
part of the town to exclude the Assembly from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
hall. The Town Council pleaded that they had
given their promise, and were obliged to abide by it;
but the Estates offered to meet even in the Castle
itself, if a room were provided for them; and when
Rudolf refused their proposal, they gathered in the
open place between All Saints’ Church and the
cathedral. There Rudolf came to them, and rebuked
them for continuing to meet. They answered by requesting
him to summon a General Assembly, which
should represent not only Bohemia, but all its dependent
provinces. After some hesitation, Rudolf consented
to this proposal; but, as he persisted in
forbidding the Estates to hold any meetings in the
interval, they returned to their former position in the
Council House of the New Town.</p>

<p>Adam von Sternberg had now been practically
thrust aside by the Assembly; and Budovĕc was
recognised not only as their actual but also as their
official leader. He impressed on the movement that
zealously religious character which the Brotherhood
always endeavoured to maintain. He always opened
the proceedings with prayer, and sternly repressed all
immorality or disorder among the followers of the
nobles, who were now flocking into the town. The
Assembly felt that the use of physical force could
not be much longer avoided; they attended the
meetings ready armed; and on one occasion, when
an attack from the king’s forces was expected, even
the workmen hastened into the square and brandished
their tools for the fray.</p>

<p>In the meantime the appeals of the Assembly for
foreign help had been producing their effect. Matthias,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
indeed, seemed for a time unwilling to press
his victories further, and declined to interfere between
Rudolf and the Estates; but the German princes
were so zealous in their appeals to the Emperor to
make concessions, that he seemed at last disposed to
set aside the opinion of his more fiery Councillors,
and he summoned a General Assembly for the 25th
of May, 1609. No sooner, however, did the Assembly
meet, than Lobkovic recovered his former influence
over the Emperor; and Rudolf began to hope that he
might make divisions between the Catholics and
Protestants. On the other hand, the demands of
the Protestants appear to have grown more extreme
at this time; for they not only required the free profession
of their creed and the right to build churches,
but they also insisted that the University of Prague
and the Utraquist Consistory should be placed under
the control of the Estates.</p>

<p>This last demand excited more interest than the
fallen condition of Utraquism might have led one to
expect. But traditions of former greatness have an
incalculable influence; and many of the Protestants
believed that the failure of Utraquism had been due
as much to the control which the king exercised over
the Consistory as to any internal weakness. Therefore
the Assembly’s demand for control over the
Consistory excited considerable sympathy among
all classes of Protestants. Rudolf, while unwilling to
surrender his power in this matter, was yet willing to
propose a compromise, to the effect that the Consistory
should be managed by a special tribunal composed
half of Protestants and half of Catholics. As,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
however, he no doubt intended that these should be
appointed by himself, the Assembly considered this
answer as a complete rejection of their proposal; and
on June 22, 1609, the Estates resolved, on the motion
of Count Thurn, to make arrangements for the arming
of the whole population. Their indignation was still
further roused by the oppression inflicted on the
Protestants of Braunau by the abbot of that town;
and the resolution for universal arming was soon
followed by the election of thirty Defenders for
carrying on the struggle.</p>

<p>It is a curious proof of the aristocratic influences
which still prevailed in the Assembly, that Peter
Vok of Rosenberg was the first Defender chosen.
He had been the only prominent Bohemian who
had sympathised with Matthias’s invasion of Bohemia;
and, though he had not supported him by force
of arms, he had supplied money to his troops. Apart
also from this difference of policy, Rosenberg must
have been a distasteful ally to the stricter Protestants,
on account of his profligate life. Other names of
powerful families also appear in the list, and at the
same time Count Thurn was made general of the
forces.</p>

<p>The Protestants now withdrew from their attendance
at the Assembly; Count Thurn quickly
gathered five hundred men together in three days;
the alliance with the Silesians was formally confirmed;
and application was made to Christian of
Anhalt for further help.</p>

<p>Rudolf, alarmed at these proceedings, was yet
further startled by the news that Matthias had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
granted to the Austrian Assembly all its demands
for religious freedom. Moreover he found that the
Roman Catholic part of the Assembly, which had
at first been disposed to resist Budovĕc, were now
ready to make terms with the Protestants. He
therefore declared his willingness to accept the proposals
of the Assembly on three conditions: (1)
That they would substitute “Utraquist” for “Evangelical”
in their description of the Protestants; (2)
that they would accept the present concessions as
a provisional arrangement, until the general peace
could be made with the Protestants; and (3) that
they would abandon the proposal for universal arming.
Budovĕc answered by accepting the two first
conditions; but he declared that the Defenders
could not consent, at present, to lay down their
arms without special authority from the Estates, and
special sanction from the Silesians. Even this refusal
Rudolf was obliged to accept; and on the 9th
of July he signed the Letter of Majesty which practically
decreed the points demanded by the Protestants.
For the moment it seemed as if the victory
of religious freedom was complete; for while, on the
one hand, the power of the Estates was extended
over the University and the Consistory, and was
still supported by an armed force, on the other hand
the concession of religious liberty was no longer confined
to communities or privileged classes, but extended
to every man and woman in the Bohemian
kingdom.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the apparent peace was a very hollow
one. Christian of Anhalt, arriving in Prague very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
shortly after this decision, was at first somewhat
startled to find the matter settled without his intervention;
but he soon discovered that neither Rudolf
nor the Assembly were satisfied. Budovĕc and his
friends were eager to follow up their victory by
securing the removal of Lobkovic from the councils
of Rudolf, while they wished to guard themselves
against future attacks by an amnesty for any offences
committed during the struggle. Rudolf, on his part,
while conceding the amnesty, tried hard to throw
difficulties in the way of the complete equality
between Protestants and Catholics; and he further
hoped to stir up division between the different sections
of the Protestants. Had Rudolf been left to
himself, these intrigues might have proved the mere
fitful caprices of a weak mind, and might have been
followed by equally startling concessions. But he
had now fallen into the hands of a much more daring
and unscrupulous adviser than any who had hitherto
swayed his counsels.</p>

<p>This was his young kinsman, the Archduke Leopold,
who had stood by him when the rest of the
family had demanded his submission to Matthias, and
who now flattered him with the hopes of recovering
his power in Bohemia. Leopold seems, from first to
last, to have been as self-seeking in his objects as he
was unscrupulous in his methods. His first wish was
to secure for himself that province of Jülich which
was the subject of so much controversy between
several of the Protestant princes, and which Leopold
had been allowed by Rudolf to occupy in the
Emperor’s name. Soon, however, he discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
his hopes of Jülich would be frustrated even by
Powers to whom he had looked for support; and,
from that time, he fixed his hopes on the succession
to the Bohemian crown. Rudolf, while listening to
the violent proposals of Leopold, was anxious to
secure, if possible, the recovery of the lands which
Matthias had conquered; and for that recovery he
expected help from the discontented Austrian Protestants
and from some of the princes of the Empire.
He therefore summoned a Convention of princes to
Prague, and distinctly demanded the restoration to
him of Austria, Hungary, and Moravia.</p>

<p>The times were terribly critical. The occupation
of Donauwörth by the Elector of Bavaria, the controversy
about the succession to Jülich, the formation of
the Protestant Union by Christian of Anhalt, and of
the Catholic League by Maximilian of Bavaria, all
seemed to point to an approaching war in the Empire;
while the military preparations which Henry IV. was
making in France foreshadowed a European character
for any conflict that might take place. Under these
circumstances, however, the wiser statesmen in the
Empire were anxious to minimise the evil as far as
possible, and to make efforts for the preservation of
peace.</p>

<p>Foremost among the peacemakers was the Archbishop
of Köln; but unfortunately he was too much
in advance of his age to produce the results which
a more commonplace politician might have accomplished.
He proposed a scheme of universal disarmament,
and he suggested the reference of the
Jülich controversy to the arbitration of the Universities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
These proposals were cut short by a new
outbreak of war between some of the claimants to
the Jülich estate; while the assassination of Henry
IV. once more raised the hopes of Rudolf and his
friends, and made them disinclined to concession.
But others besides the Archbishop of Köln desired
to reconcile Rudolf to Matthias; and in spite of
evasions and resistances, Rudolf was forced, in September,
1610, to recognise his brother as holding
under him the lands of Hungary, Moravia, and
Austria.</p>

<p>This concession was, if possible, even less honest
in intention than the confirmation of the Letter of
Majesty had been; for the coldness with which he
had been treated by the princes of the Empire had
made Rudolf even more inclined than before to throw
himself into the dangerous plans of the Archduke
Leopold. Even while the Convention of Princes was
sitting and the negotiations with Matthias were proceeding,
Leopold was raising troops in the Bavarian
district of Passau, and by the time that the agreement
was concluded this force had grown to a considerable
size. Peter Vok of Rosenberg had called
attention to the danger incurred by his town of
Krumov through the neighbourhood of these soldiers;
and the Bohemian Assembly demanded that, since
peace had now been made, this force should be disbanded.
Rudolf pleaded that he could not yet dismiss
them, because he had no money for the payment of
their wages; and he proposed that, to secure them
better quarters, they should be sent to Krumov and
Budweis (Budejóvice). The Bohemian Assembly indignantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
protested against the introduction of foreign
troops into their country, and they refused to vote
any money for their support.</p>

<p>Rudolf thereupon appealed to the Duke of Brunswick
to advance him money; and the Duke succeeded
in getting various promises which soon
amounted to the sum required. When he arrived
at Passau, he found that Leopold and several of the
other commanders had left for Prague; that Colonel
Ramée, who was in command, would not listen to
proposals of delay; and that the paymaster of the
forces was being hindered from receiving the money
which had been raised for the troops. At last, when
the soldiers had been worked up to a state of frenzy
by the non-fulfilment of the promises of payment,
Ramée suddenly led them into Upper Austria, where
they committed every kind of cruelty on the defenceless
inhabitants. Rudolf had cherished the wild hope
that the discontent of the Austrian Protestants with
Matthias would make them willing to revolt from
him; but he soon found that, whatever might be their
disagreements with their present ruler, they at any
rate preferred him to Rudolf. So, after failing to
obtain any success in Austria, Leopold suddenly
changed his plans; and in February, 1611, the Bohemian
Assembly were startled by the news that the
Passau forces had entered Bohemia, had seized Krumov,
and had soon after captured Budejóvice and
Tabor. A little later came the news that Ramée
was on his march to Prague.</p>

<p>Leopold offered to go out to meet the troops, and
to order them to return to Krumov; but on February<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
13th he suddenly reappeared before Prague at
the head of the very forces that he had pretended
to disband. Two days later they broke into the
Small Division of the town; and, though gallantly
resisted by Count Thurn at the head of both soldiers
and citizens, Leopold succeeded in mastering that
division of the city. But in the Old and New Town
the citizens rallied and drove back the Passauer.
The old fierce spirit now awoke in Prague; and, as
soon as Leopold and his forces had been expelled
from the Old Town, the citizens attacked and destroyed
several of the monasteries; and the troops of
the Assembly with difficulty succeeded in saving the
Jesuit College from a similar fate. Leopold now
marched against the Castle, and, after a short parley,
persuaded the troops to surrender. A herald was
next despatched to the Karlsbrücke to demand that
the Old Town should receive a Passau garrison.
Count Thurn and two of the other generals were
wounded, and prisoners in the hands of the enemy;
and Budovĕc had been sent into Moravia shortly
before the advance of the Passauer. But though
deprived of their leaders, both military and spiritual,
the Praguer still held out against the enemy. The
Imperial herald was dismissed with scorn; and when
Ramée threatened to fire upon the town, several
workmen announced that, at the first shot, every
Catholic in the city should be put to death. Rudolf
himself became shocked at the cruelties which had
been committed, and refused to allow Ramée to set
the town on fire. The peasantry flocked in from the
surrounding districts to help in the defence; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
they cut off and killed all the supporters of the
Passauer whom they could find in the outskirts of
the town. Budovĕc returned from Moravia at this
crisis, and encouraged the Praguer by promises of
fresh help, and it soon became known that Matthias
was on his march to Prague.</p>

<p>Leopold, as cowardly as he was cruel, now proposed
to desert the cause of Rudolf, and offered his services
to Matthias. The latter, however, would have nothing
to say to him; and Ramée, in his turn becoming
alarmed, tried to make sure of his spoil by sending it
in waggons out of the city. The Praguer, however,
succeeded in intercepting these waggons, and in
arresting, at the same time, one of Leopold’s intriguers.
The prisoner at once confessed the whole
plot; and Ramée, fearing the results of the discovery,
secretly marched away from the city. In order to
persuade his troops to go the more readily, he produced
a portion of their long withheld pay. This
suddenly revealed to them the base intrigue of which
they had been at once the victims and the tools; and
they called upon their colonel to lead them back to
Prague, to execute vengeance on Leopold. Leopold
however, succeeded in escaping secretly from the
city, and went to Budejóvice, where he still hoped to
make a stand; but when the Pope himself wrote to
tell him that he had injured and disgraced the
Catholic cause, the miserable creature felt the helplessness
of his position, and tried to convince the Pope
that he had been in no way responsible for the march
of the Passauer.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Matthias was welcomed as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
deliverer. On April 12, 1611, the Bohemian Assembly
once more met; and, after some wrangling between
the Estates of the different provinces, about the
language to be used and the methods to be followed,
they deposed Rudolf from the throne of Bohemia;
and on May 22nd he himself consented to free his
subjects from their allegiance, and to allow Matthias
to be crowned in his place. Even now the unfortunate
Emperor still hoped to redeem his position by fresh
intrigues; and he seems actually to have entertained
the idea of appealing to Christian of Anhalt, and the
Protestants, against Matthias; but ill health, misfortunes,
and growing old age interfered to cut short
any further plots; and his miserable life at last
ended in January, 1612.</p>

<h2>XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE DEATH OF RUDOLF II. TO THE BATTLE
OF THE WHITE HILL.<br />
(1612-1620.)</span></h2>

<p>Although Matthias seemed now to be securely
seated on the throne of Bohemia, he was quite aware
that his difficulties were by no means at an end. He
had been put forward, originally, as the candidate
rather of his family than of the Bohemian people;
and his necessary concessions to popular feeling, in
the matter of civil and religious liberty, had often
roused the opposition of his kinsmen.</p>

<p>The difficulties of his position had been somewhat
mitigated during his first triumphs in Moravia by the
judicious statesmanship, administrative ability, and
personal popularity of Z̆erotin. On the one hand he
had persuaded his friends to keep in the background
their extremer demands for religious liberty; and on
the other hand he had contrived, by ingenious exercises
of administrative power, to strain the actual concessions
of the new ruler to such an extent that they
proved a better check on the tyranny of nobles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
priests than the (verbally) larger concessions of
Rudolf’s Letter of Majesty. Illyezhazy and the
Hungarian Protestants had consented to follow the
lead of Z̆erotin in these matters; but in Austria
Matthias had already had a foretaste of the embarrassments
which were to be increased by his conquest of
Bohemia.</p>

<p>Tschernembl, who led the Protestants of Upper
Austria, was by no means disposed to be content with
half measures, either in civil or religious liberty. He
was a strong Calvinist; and while he had none of
Z̆erotin’s scruples about religious wars, he was also
far more indifferent than the Moravian noble to kings
in general, and to the House of Hapsburg in particular.
Under his leadership the Protestants of Upper Austria
demanded the fullest securities for their liberties,
before they would accept Matthias as their Duke; and
they seized on a castle in Linz, as a pledge for future
concessions. In Lower Austria the Protestants were,
at this time, less numerous or less determined; for
when, in September, 1608, Matthias summoned representatives
of both the Austrian provinces to meet at
Vienna, he found himself able to resist and defeat the
demands of the Protestants. Upon this, Tschernembl
and his friends at once left the city, and took up their
quarters at Horn, from which step they became
known as the “Horner.” This policy of Tschernembl’s
produced some coolness between him and Z̆erotin;
Tschernembl was in consequence thrown into closer
relations with the German Protestants; so when, in
November, 1608, Peter Vok von Rosenberg invited
Christian of Anhalt to meet Z̆erotin and Tschernembl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
at Tr̆ebon̆, the Austrian consented to come, but the
Moravian refused.</p>

<p>Z̆erotin, however, while anxious to hinder violent
opposition to Matthias, had no wish to hinder the
growth of Austrian liberty nor to break the link
between the Austrian and Bohemian Protestants; so
he strongly urged Matthias to concede the demands
of Tschernembl and his friends, in a peaceable manner.
This advice was the more important because Tschernembl
was inclined, in a moment of irritation, to
listen to advances from Rudolf; but he soon discovered
the folly of that course, and at the same time
he began to lose faith in the promises of Christian of
Anhalt. Thus Z̆erotin was able once more to bring
his king and his friend together; and in March, 1609,
Matthias granted much wider liberties to the Austrian
Protestants than he had yet conceded in Moravia.</p>

<p>But this triumph of Z̆erotin’s policy brought on
him the fierce hostility of Bishop Khlesl, who even
refused to give the Sacrament to Matthias and his
councillors, on the occasion of the festival of reconciliation
between the Duke of Austria and his subjects.
Nor was Z̆erotin contented with Matthias’s own action;
for the latter began to show signs, at that time,
of an inclination to treat with Rudolph; and a proposal
of the Moravian Assembly to disband some of its
forces just before the outbreak of the Passau rising,
was in vain resisted by Z̆erotin. When, then, Matthias
finally succeeded in winning the crown of Bohemia,
he found himself surrounded by Councillors who were
bitterly opposed to each other, and who had each
their own reasons for distrusting their King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>Nor were Matthias’s difficulties confined to those
larger questions of civil and religious liberty which
affected the whole kingdom. The reunion of Bohemia,
Moravia, and Silesia under one king, at once reawakened
controversies which had, for some time,
fallen into the background. Silesia was by no means
disposed to abandon that position of equal alliance
with Bohemia which had been granted in the hour of
danger; and Moravia did not desire to exchange the
complete independence which she had gained by
separation, for the subordinate condition in which the
Bohemians wished to place her. Concessions therefore
had to be made to the local feeling of the dependent
provinces&mdash;concessions which might conceivably
have worked well in a time of complete peace, but
which, in a time of continual disorder and mutual
suspicion, led necessarily to further difficulties.</p>

<p>But Khlesl saw that these local divisions, though
they might at first sight seem to embarrass Matthias,
could yet be made, by judicious management, to
promote those schemes for the increase of the royal
power which the ambitious bishop had been always
devising. It was in Hungary that he specially hoped
to lay the foundations of a firmer despotism; and the
method by which he hoped to accomplish it was a war
for the conquest and annexation of Transylvania.
For this purpose he stirred up the Transylvanians
against their Prince, and then backed the insurgents by
an invasion of their territory. The suspicions of the
Hungarian Protestants were, however, quickly aroused;
and Matthias was deserted by his troops. Then he
appealed to Moravia for help, on the ground of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
dangers to which their province would be exposed by
a Turkish invasion, and the consequent need of consolidating
the Hungarian power for their protection.</p>

<p>Here again Khlesl was, for the time, defeated by
Z̆erotin, who opposed the war on the ground that no
Hungarian Assembly had sanctioned it; but when
Z̆erotin followed up this victory by attempting to
revive his scheme for a common Assembly of all
Matthias’s subjects, he was successfully opposed by
the Bohemians, who declined any close union with
Austria or Hungary.</p>

<p>But if, for the time, Khlesl’s hopes for strengthening
Matthias, by the divisions among his subjects, had
been scarcely realised to the full, he soon found a new
encouragement in the increased power and dignity
which the King of Bohemia gained by his election to
the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. Z̆erotin,
indeed, had himself supported Matthias’s candidature
in order to exclude a more dangerous claimant; but,
nevertheless, the election was felt to be a distinct gain
to the Catholic and despotic party; and Khlesl took
advantage of it to renew his attacks on the Protestants.
In these attacks he was backed by Dietrichstein, the
Bishop of Olmütz, who hoped that Matthias would
help him to increase his power over the clergy and
their dependants.</p>

<p>But again Z̆erotin succeeded in resisting the clerical
encroachments in Moravia; and his opposition so
impressed the Archduke Maximilian that he used
his influence with Matthias to obtain concessions to
the Protestants. Matthias, however, soon found that
no concessions would induce the Moravian Estates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
to sanction the Hungarian war; and even an appeal
to the Presburg Assembly had no better success.</p>

<p>Imperial authority having thus failed, Matthias
once more fell back on his old attempt to sow division
among his subjects. This time, however, he appealed
not to provincial jealousies, but to the old class
rivalries between citizen and noble. He had, no
doubt, heard how his original conquest of Moravia
had been hindered by the opposition of the city
burgomasters to the decision of the nobles; and he
therefore hoped that, now that the nobles were his
most dangerous enemies, the municipal authorities
might be induced to rally round him. He was further
strengthened in this belief by the recollection that
his aristocratic supporters had been willing to abandon
on behalf of the towns those religious liberties which
they had claimed to exercise on their own estates.</p>

<p>This time he hit the mark. The Town Councils
of Brünn and Olmütz readily responded to his appeal
to support him against his rebellious nobles; and
they even denounced to the King those citizens who
had complained of the exclusion of Protestants from
the government of the towns. Matthias encouraged
these appeals, and disregarded the protest of Z̆erotin,
who maintained that the towns could only approach
the King through the Captain of Moravia.</p>

<p>Having secured this weapon, Matthias determined
to use it to the uttermost. Hitherto, the houses of
the nobles had been free from any interference, in the
matter of religious worship; and citizens, who had
been excluded from Protestant services elsewhere,
had been allowed to attend them when celebrated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
a nobleman’s house. Now, however, Matthias not
only took away this liberty, but summoned to Vienna
some of the citizens who attended these services.</p>

<p>Yet no threats nor tyrannies could induce the
Estates to sanction the Transylvanian war; and
Matthias’s insistence on this expedition only roused
the suspicion of the German Princes, and once more
drew Christian of Anhalt into alliance with the Protestants
of Bohemia, Austria, and Hungary.</p>

<p>Had Matthias been a shrewder politician, he would
have abstained from giving artificial stimulus to the
local jealousies of his subjects, and would have suffered
them to grow into importance of their own accord.
It soon appeared that, whatever reaction might be
exerted by the king’s mischief-making policy, the
rivalry between Moravia and Bohemia was still an
important force in national politics. It is not easy to
estimate the exact force of all the considerations
which influenced the leaders of the rival provinces.
The name of liberty, for instance, could be appealed
to, with some sincerity, on either side of the controversy.
Z̆erotin, for his part, was thoroughly convinced
that a centralised administration at Prague
would hinder the free play of the local institutions of
Moravia, and would also weaken the possibilities of
that independent alliance between Austria, Bohemia,
Silesia, Moravia, and Hungary, which seemed to him
the best protection for the Protestants against the
encroachments of the Catholic party.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Bohemians could justly
maintain that Rudolf’s Letter of Majesty gave them,
and all who united with them, wider liberties than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
any which were secured by the laws of Moravia;
and, curiously enough, the most dependent classes of
Moravia had been deprived by their separation from
Bohemia of a right of appeal to a court at Prague
which still gave them some slight protection against
the power of their lords.</p>

<p>But, important as all these questions were, they
were gradually driven into the background by one of
more immediate interest to the rival leaders. Z̆erotin
had, as already mentioned, a special feeling of loyalty
to the House of Hapsburg, which was not shared in
the same degree by the leaders of the Bohemian
Protestants. So Budovĕc and his friends were rapidly
arriving at the conclusion that the best security for
their liberties was to be found, not in the substitution
of one Hapsburg for another, but in the deposition
of the whole family in favour of some king who had
a real respect for religious liberty. To such a step
Z̆erotin could not consent; and it was no doubt
because he was aware of this difference, that Matthias
now began to recognise the Bohemian leaders as his
chief enemies, and to devote himself to the special
oppression of their province.</p>

<p>In 1613, the freedom of the press was suspended
in Bohemia, and a censorship was re-established. A
Jesuit preacher denounced the Letter of Majesty, declaring
that it had never been formally sanctioned by
Rudolf. The Archbishop of Prague began to close
Protestant churches and to turn out Protestant priests.
But a still more ominous hint of the bitterness of the
approaching struggle was to be found in the character
of the man whom the Archdukes now chose as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
representative of their family in the controversy.
The conciliatory policy of the Archduke Maximilian
seemed a hopeless failure. Matthias, in the opinion
of his kinsmen, was becoming as incapable as Rudolf
had been. They therefore resolved to choose from
their family a man of strong and determined character,
who would be willing if necessary to take the most
extreme measures for enforcing their policy.</p>

<p>This champion of the family reaction was found in
Ferdinand, Duke of Styria. He had been trained by
the Jesuits in a fierce enthusiasm for the Catholic faith.
He had carried out a ruthless policy in Styria against
the Protestant preachers; and he had there compelled
both citizens and peasants to attend the Catholic
services. He had already been proposed by the
extremer Catholics as a candidate for the Imperial
throne; and it was to hinder his election that Z̆erotin
supported the election of Matthias. Matthias, indeed,
was now weary of his position, and he was particularly
glad that Ferdinand should take his place in facing
the hostility of the Moravian Assembly; but a new,
and perhaps unexpected, opponent came forward at
the next meeting of that Assembly, to resist the
policy of the Emperor and his champion. Bishop
Khlesl had never been popular with the main body
of the House of Hapsburg. They considered that his
personal influence over Matthias tended to separate
the policy of that prince from the general schemes of
the House. The Bishop therefore understood that the
rise of Ferdinand to power would be the prelude to
his own fall. His recent elevation to the rank of
Cardinal encouraged him to venture on a more independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
policy; and, with the help of Z̆erotin, he
succeeded in defeating another proposal for a grant
in aid of the Transylvanian war.</p>

<p>But Matthias’s old policy of ruling by dividing was
at last to obtain an unexpected and signal success.
It will be remembered that Silesia, like Moravia, had
secured, after Matthias’s coronation in Prague, a much
more independent position than had been conceded
to it in earlier days; and it was one result of the new
position of these provinces, that they were now able
and eager to contend against each other, like independent
kingdoms, for the possession of territory
which might have been previously accepted by them
as a part of their common Kingdom of Bohemia.
The land specially in dispute was the district of
Troppau, which appears to have had some separate
Assembly of its own, but which some of the dukes
of Silesia considered to be closely connected with
their province. The Moravians, on the other hand,
believed that Troppau more properly belonged to
them; and, as they were more ready to recognise
the rights of the Troppau Assembly, it seems probable
that the popular feeling in that district would
incline to the Moravian side. But Matthias, remembering
that Moravia had successfully opposed his
military projects, eagerly advocated the cause of
Silesia; and, while securing to that province a more
complete independence of the Bohemian Chancellor,
he declared at the same time that the ruler of Troppau
must be a prince of Silesia. To weaken the Moravians
still further, by sowing division in their own ranks, he
chose Karl von Lichtenstein as Duke of Troppau and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
Prince of Silesia. The bitter quarrel which followed
this decision had an important effect on the future of
the country; for Charles of Z̆erotin was thereby convinced
that his hope for a peaceful league between
the three provinces had become a vain dream; and,
in February, 1615, he resigned his Captaincy of
Moravia, and was succeeded by a member of the
Catholic party.</p>

<p>While this increasing separation between the differing
provinces was bringing further weakness to the
Protestant cause, the Archdukes were being driven
forward to an extremer Catholic policy. The new
attitude of Khlesl had irritated against him even the
moderate Maximilian, and had decided the Archdukes
to demand the deposition of Khlesl’s patron
and pupil, first from the Bohemian, and afterwards
from the Imperial, throne; and the substitution of
Ferdinand for him in both those dignities.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand how it was that, in
June, 1617, the Catholic party seem to have gained
a power in Bohemia greater than they possessed
either in the previous or the following year; though
no doubt the surprise at Matthias’s decision, and the
absence of any possible successor, had placed the
Estates in a position of great difficulty. At any rate,
so it was, that Count Thurn and Colonna von Fels
were the only members of the Assembly who ventured
to oppose Ferdinand’s election; while the majority
not only raised no objection, but even abandoned that
right of free election on which they had insisted in
the time of Ferdinand I.; and they “accepted” their
new sovereign as the necessary heir to the kingdom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
Some little remnant of spirit, however, was shown
in the demand that Ferdinand should confirm the
privileges of the Estates before he was crowned; and,
after consulting with his Jesuit advisers, he gave his
approval, even to Rudolf’s Letter of Majesty.</p>

<p>But no sooner was Ferdinand seated on the throne,
than he proceeded to violate the principle, if not the
letter, of the promises which he had just made. He
directed the judges of his chief tribunal to preside
at the meetings of the Church Congregations in
Prague; to inquire into all their accounts, and to
allow no decision to be passed by them which the
judges had not approved. Further they were to
examine all the institutions connected with each
church; to find out if they carried out the purposes
of their founders and, if not, to compel them to do so.
This decree was intended as a step towards the
restoration to the Catholics of all the churches which
had passed into Utraquist hands. At the same time,
the Archbishop of Prague, who had already demanded
the closing of a Protestant church at Hroby, now
insisted that that church should be pulled down.
Sometimes, as in the case of the monastery of Braunau,
the encroachments of the Catholics were defended
on the ground of some peculiar interpretation of
Rudolf’s Letter of Majesty; but it was evident that
the attacks on the Protestants would not long be
limited by any legal pretences. The Defenders of
the Protestants, who had been chosen during the
struggle against Rudolf, still retained their offices;
and they now summoned a Protestant Assembly to
meet in Prague on March 5, 1618. The towns, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
would not venture to send representatives to
this Assembly; and the nobles who did come
decided to defer action until the Estates of all the
Crown Lands could meet on the 21st of May.</p>

<p>The Royalist Party resolved to counteract this
movement by every means in their power. They
tried hard to separate the towns still further from the
nobles; and they hoped to draw the representatives
of the old Utraquists away from the other Protestants.
The attempt to influence the towns had
some partial success; but nevertheless six of them
(including Kutna Hora and Mláda Boleslav) consented
to send representatives to the new Assembly.
The attempt to separate the Utraquists from their
fellow Protestants was a complete failure, for all
the parish clergy of Prague consented to announce
from their pulpits the meeting of the
Assembly.</p>

<p>It was now clear that a violent crisis was unavoidable;
and no sooner did the Assembly meet in the
Carolinum than two officials of the Emperor entered
the building, and announced that Matthias forbad
them to continue their discussions. The Protestants
were seriously alarmed; and Count Thurn demanded
that, as they had been summoned to the Castle to
meet the representatives of the Emperor, they should
be allowed to wear arms on that occasion. The
official representative of Matthias consented to this
proposal; and on May 22nd Count Thurn had a
special meeting with Budovĕc, Colonna von Fels, and
a few others, at which they resolved on their plan of
action. A rumour rapidly spread that the Protestants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
were planning some violent attack; and one of the
officials fled secretly to Vienna.</p>

<p>On May 23rd the Estates gathered in the great
Hall of Assembly at the Castle; and, as soon as the
letter of the Emperor had been read, the Protestants
read their letter of protest against his prohibition of
their meeting. Then they demanded to know who
had advised the Emperor to threaten the Estates.
Adam of Sternberg, who was now chief Burggraf of
Prague, refused to answer this question, on the ground
that Privy Councillors were not bound to reveal the
advice which they had given to the Emperor. Count
Thurn replied that the Estates would not leave that
place till they had received an answer to their question.
Then a number of charges were fiercely poured
out against the advisers of the Emperor; and
Martinic and Slavata were reminded of their resistance
to the Assembly of 1609, and especially of their
refusal to sign the Letter of Majesty. One of Count
Thurn’s followers denounced them as enemies of the
commonwealth; and this charge was received with
shouts of applause by the other members of the
Estates. Sternberg entreated the Assembly to be
calm; but he was urged to retire from the Hall,
and was at last forced out of it, with one of the
other officials. Then William of Lobkovic suddenly
seized upon Martinic, and, after a fierce struggle,
flung him from the window down into the castle
ditch, which was twenty-eight ells below; and Thurn
threw Slavata after him. Their secretary, Fabricius,
protested, and was in his turn thrown out of the
window. Wonderful to say, none of the three were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
killed; and only Fabricius seems to have been
seriously injured. They succeeded in taking refuge
in the house of the Chancellor; and afterwards they
escaped secretly from the city.</p>

<p class="caption">HALL IN THE CASTLE OF PRAGUE FROM WHENCE MARTINIC AND
SLAVATA WERE THROWN.</p>

</div>

<p>A provisional government was at once formed of
thirty Defenders. Wenceslaus of Ruppa, who had
taken a leading part in this plot, was chosen President,
and Count Thurn was once more appointed General
of the Bohemian forces. The towns now gathered
courage to join the movement; and only Budweis
(Budejóvice), Pilsen (Plz̆en), and Krumov remained on
the side of the Emperor. Matthias would even now
have wished to conciliate his opponents; and, on the
6th of June, a messenger arrived in Prague announcing
the Emperor’s willingness once more to confirm the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
Letter of Majesty. But this message was speedily
followed by a letter from Ferdinand, announcing that
he would only observe the Letter of Majesty in the
same way that he had done hitherto; and he further
threatened punishment against all who would not
keep the peace. The Assembly saw the significance
of this letter, and continued their preparations for
war.</p>

<p>Ferdinand was now eager for action; but he found
that Matthias still hindered his proceedings. This
opposition the Archdukes attributed to the influence
of Khlesl; and Maximilian was entrusted with the
office of suppressing the Cardinal. For this purpose
he paid a visit of apparent friendliness to Khlesl;
but, when the cardinal returned the call, he found
himself suddenly seized by Maximilian’s servants,
stripped of his Cardinal’s robe, forced into a carriage,
and driven off to Innsbrück, where he was kept a
prisoner till the end of the Bohemian struggle.</p>

<p>But there were still other advisers, who claimed to
be heard against the war. Both in Hungary and
Upper Austria, the Estates, though unwilling to take
active part with the Bohemians, urged Matthias to
take peaceable measures for the restoring of order
in Bohemia. In the Moravian Assembly, a resolution
in favour of a similar policy was carried by Z̆erotin’s
influence; though many of his colleagues would have
preferred to give more active support to the Bohemians.
The Protestant princes of Germany, however,
and particularly the Elector Palatine, were
eager for forcible resistance to Matthias; and a son
of the Margrave of Brandenburg, who was also a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
prince of Silesia, persuaded his Silesian colleagues to
assist the Bohemians. It was evident that war could
no longer be avoided, and Matthias despatched Count
Bucquoi to Bohemia. Count Mansfeld and the
Elector Palatine had already sent troops to assist
the Protestants; and Bucquoi was so thoroughly
defeated at Lomnice, near Budejóvice, that he urged
Matthias to make peace. The hopes of the Bohemians
were further encouraged by Count Mansfeld’s capture
of Pilsen; and Count Thurn resolved to invade
Austria, and to attack Ferdinand at his headquarters.
Now, however, there arose new difficulties. Tschernembl,
indeed, tried to rouse the Austrians in defence
of the Protestant cause; but he found only a very
partial support; while an attempt to persuade the
Moravians to assist the Bohemian invasion was
defeated by the influence of Z̆erotin, who bitterly
denounced Thurn and Ruppa for making a religious
movement the cover for their political intrigues.
These rebuffs impressed on the Bohemians the
necessity of strengthening their alliances with the
German Protestants; and Ruppa sent a message to
the Elector Palatine, to invite him to become king of
Bohemia. Frederick V. was unwilling to accept this
proposal. He understood that the Duke of Savoy
was likely to dispute his claim to the Bohemian
throne; and he also believed that his father-in-law,
James I. of England, would object to his acceptance
of that dignity. He did not, however, directly refuse;
and the necessity for decisive action was still further
shown by two deaths which took place about this
time; that of the Archduke Maximilian, the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
conciliatory member of the House of Hapsburg, and
that of the Emperor Matthias a few months later.</p>

<p>Ferdinand was now face to face with his enemies,
without any check upon his purposes. The alarm
among the Protestants was all the greater for these
events. The Silesian Assembly joined with their
princes in support of Bohemia; Lausitz followed
their lead; in spite of the resistance of Z̆erotin, many
of the Moravian nobles also joined the cause; and
the citizens of Jíhlava welcomed Count Thurn into
their town. Carl von Lichtenstein, who was generally
on the winning side, joined the Protestants in
their support of the Bohemians; two attempts on the
part of colonels to carry off their troops to Ferdinand
met with complete failure; and at last Z̆erotin was
put under arrest in his own house, and a provisional
government was proclaimed in Moravia, and entrusted
with power to co-operate with the Bohemians.
The hopes of the Austrian Protestants
were roused by this new phase of the movement;
and Tschernembl at last persuaded the Estates of
Upper Austria to declare in favour of the insurgents.</p>

<p>Thurn’s opportunity now seemed to have come;
in May, 1619, he entered Austria, defeated some of
Ferdinand’s forces, and marched to Vienna. But
Ferdinand remained undaunted. He summoned
before him the representatives of the Lower Austrian
Estates, appealed to their sense of patriotism, and
tried to persuade them to resist the Bohemians. He
had been arguing in vain for some time, when suddenly
the scene was changed by the entrance into the Hall
of four cornets of horse, who had been secretly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
summoned by Ferdinand. The resistance of the
Protestants was suddenly paralysed; and, when Thurn
appeared before Vienna the next day, he found the
citizens so unwilling to help him that he was forced
to abandon the siege, and hastened back to defend
Bohemia. There the contest had continued with
various fortune; but it is believed that Bucquoi
might soon have carried the day, had not a new
ally appeared on the Bohemian side.</p>

<p>Bethlen Gabor, the new Prince of Transylvania,
saw from the first that the success of Ferdinand
would naturally lead to those renewed invasions of
Transylvania which had played so important a part
in the policy both of Rudolf and Matthias. The
Hungarian Assembly had been at first unwilling to
co-operate with the Bohemians; but, during his expedition
to Vienna, Count Thurn had made the
acquaintance of a leading Hungarian Protestant,
whom he had roused to sympathy with the Bohemian
cause. When this leader returned to Hungary, he
soon convinced his friends that the cause of Protestantism
was bound up with the effort for Bohemian
independence; and, when Bethlen Gabor openly
declared war on Ferdinand, large districts of Hungary
rose on his behalf, and he speedily found himself in
occupation of Presburg.</p>

<p>This encouraging news reached the Bohemians
just as they were entering on one of the most important
stages of their movement. The representatives
of all the Bohemian provinces had met at
Prague, and, after a declaration in favour of the
Protestant cause, had formally deposed Ferdinand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
from the throne of Bohemia. Three candidates for
the throne now offered themselves&mdash;the Duke of
Savoy, the Elector of Saxony, and the Elector
Palatine of the Rhine. But the first of the three
had very much cooled in his friendship towards the
Bohemian cause, since he had found that neither
France nor England would support his claim to the
crown. The Elector of Saxony, though popular
with a small minority of Bohemians, had never been
a zealous supporter of their liberties; and he was
suspected of being a tyrannical ruler in his own
dominions. So, on the 26th of August, 1619, the
Elector Palatine of the Rhine was chosen King of
Bohemia.</p>

<p>But, during the discussions of the Assembly, a sign
had been given which might have warned the leaders
of the insurrection of one fatal weakness in their
position. The unfortunate peasantry, pressed down
by the burdens of serfdom, greatly feared the additional
evils of war. They had hoped that the
concession of spiritual freedom, which Budovĕc
had won for them, would have been followed by the
grant of other liberties, more directly improving their
material position; and they were proportionately
bitter with their favourite leader, whom they accused
of deserting them from motives of selfish ambition.
They now assured the Estates that they could not
hope for a blessing on a movement which ignored
the wrongs of the peasantry. The charge against
Budovĕc seems to have been wholly unjust. He
was now past seventy; and, though his name was
still useful to the leaders of the insurrection, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
influence on their policy was extremely small. Had
it been otherwise, the Council might have taken a
different view of this vital question. As it was, the
wrongs of the serfs were again ignored; and not
only did the Protestant leaders lose thereby a popular
basis for their movement, but they soon provoked
against them a most dangerous opposition. When
the peasantry found that the mercenary troops which
the Protestants employed were as dangerous to
natives as to foreigners, they began to think that
Ferdinand was preferable to Frederick; and peasant
risings hindered the progress of the Protestant army.</p>

<p>Frederick, of course, knew nothing as yet of this
cause of weakness in his new position. Nevertheless,
it was with a hesitating mind that he had listened to
the proposal of the Bohemian Assembly. He had
wished to wait until he could have secured the
approval of his father-in-law, King James of England;
and he knew already that he had to encounter the
opposition of France. A still more dangerous omen
for his future career had been given only two days
after this election. The Electors of the Empire on
the 28th of August had chosen Ferdinand Emperor
of Germany; and on that occasion the Elector
Palatine had been the only one who voted in the
minority.</p>

<p>But two powerful counsellors urged Frederick on
to his fate&mdash;his wife Elizabeth, and Christian of
Anhalt. The latter promised him the support of the
Protestant Union; but, though that support was most
welcome, it was believed in Bohemia that his wife’s
opinion had more weight on Frederick’s final decision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
Therefore, on September 28, 1619, he resolved on
accepting the crown, without waiting further for the
opinion of his father-in-law. The victories of Bethlen
Gabor doubtless encouraged Frederick in his dangerous
course; and the enthusiasm with which he was
received in Prague must have raised his hopes still
further. His queen, indeed, though publicly thanked
for her influence on his decision, soon became unpopular
from her English dress and ways, and her
ignorance of the Bohemian language; but this unpopularity
does not seem to have affected her
husband’s position.</p>

<p>A more serious difficulty was the inability of the
Assembly to raise money for the payment of the
troops; an evil which drove the soldiers to mutiny
and robbery, and eventually caused the rising of the
peasants against them. These evils the Bohemian
Government attempted to meet, partly by debasement
of the coinage, and partly by borrowing money
from foreign powers; but the great hope of the
Bohemians still lay in the support of Bethlen Gabor.</p>

<p>About three weeks after the coronation of Frederick,
Bethlen had invaded Austria, and was on his march
to Vienna. The Austrians were again panic-struck;
and when the peasantry discovered that they suffered
as much from the forces of Ferdinand as from the
Hungarian army, they refused to bestir themselves on
the side of the Emperor. Suddenly, however, the
news arrived that a Roman Catholic nobleman, who
had been defeated by Bethlen in the earlier part of
the struggle, had now returned to Hungary at the
head of a Polish force, and had gained a signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
victory over some of Bethlen’s supporters. Bethlen
thereupon hastened back to Hungary, and Ferdinand
hoped to get rid of this formidable opponent on
moderate terms. But this hope speedily disappeared.
Bethlen’s return to the scene of action at once restored
success to his supporters. In January, 1620, the
Hungarian Assembly formally deposed Ferdinand,
and declared Bethlen Prince of Hungary; nor could
even the acceptance of this election by his deposed
rival detach Bethlen from the Bohemian cause; and
he refused to make terms with Ferdinand until the
latter had abandoned his claim on Bohemia. This
encouraged the Bohemians yet further in their resistance;
and the Austrian Protestants also showed
considerable zeal in their cause. Tschernembl even
came to Prague and took an active part in the
organisation of the war; but he saw plainly that the
oppressed condition of the peasantry prevented the
struggle from assuming that popular character which
alone could make it successful. He therefore strongly
urged upon his colleagues the abolition of serfdom, as
a means of securing the sympathy of the peasantry.
But it was one of the weaknesses of the movement
that the Bohemian nobles were hampered throughout
by their class prejudices; and Tschernembl’s proposals
were rejected.</p>

<p>About the same time Ferdinand strengthened his
cause by the complete union of his forces with those
of the Catholic League. Maximilian of Bavaria, the
founder of that League, had cherished for some time
his hereditary suspicion and dislike to the House of
Austria; and he had been even mentioned as a rival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
when Ferdinand was first proposed as Emperor. But
the increase of the power of the Protestants gradually
brought the Catholic rivals together; and towards the
end of July, Maximilian had already consented to
assist in suppressing an Austrian rising. Now, in
September, he entered Bohemia; and his general,
Tilly, became the chief person in the Imperialist
army. This seems to have been the turning-point in
the war. Christian of Anhalt, who had joined the
Bohemian forces, was compelled to retreat to Moravia;
while one of Ferdinand’s generals was despatched to
Presburg to prevent Bethlen from marching to the
assistance of the Bohemians. One of the ablest
generals on the Bohemian side was Count Mansfeld,
a lawless soldier of fortune. He, unable to pay his
troops, had taken to plundering the Bohemian
peasantry; and, finding that Frederick and Anhalt
were both opposed to this method of warfare, he consented
to accept a bribe from the Imperialists, which
kept him quiet during their advance to Prague. This
at once led Maximilian to hope for a speedy conquest;
and, abandoning the siege of Pilsen, Bucquoi and
Tilly at once marched forward to Prague.</p>

<p>Anhalt, who had been defending Pilsen, hastened
to Rakonic, a town about thirty miles west of Prague,
in order to cut off the advance of the Imperialists.
But, in spite of his energy, the Imperialist forces
came upon the Bohemians at Rakonic before they
expected them, and utterly routed them. Frederick
at once lost heart, and sent off a messenger to
Elizabeth to tell her to fly from Prague, as all was
lost. But the Queen seems to have inherited something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
of the courage, as well as of the beauty, of her
unfortunate grandmother, Mary Queen of Scots; and
she indignantly refused to accept this advice. Anhalt
in the meantime had succeeded in rallying his forces,
and holding the Imperialists in check before Rakonic.
But on the 3rd of November, Maximilian received a
new supply of provisions; and, encouraged by this
refreshment, the Imperial army once more broke up
their camp, and continued their march to Prague.
Anhalt again attempted to anticipate their march;
and, on the night of the 7th of November, he reached
the White Hill, about an hour’s journey from Prague.</p>

<p>Some of the Hungarian forces, whom Bethlen had
previously despatched to the aid of the Bohemians,
remained at the village of Rusin, at the foot of the
hill; but they were there attacked and driven into
flight by the cavalry of the Imperialists, neither their
German nor their Bohemian allies attempting to rescue
them. Again the wretched King of Bohemia was
seized with a panic; and this time he actually fled
from the army, and did not stop till he reached
Prague. Bucquoi desired to leave the enemy unattacked,
and to advance straight to Prague; but
Tilly did not think it safe to leave Anhalt’s army in
the rear; and, while they were still discussing the
point, Dr. Angelini, a chaplain of Maximilian’s, exhorted
them to fight, as God would protect them.
This at once decided the Generals; and, as Bucquoi
was wounded, Tiefenbach took his place at the head
of his forces. The first opening of the battle was
favourable to the Bohemians. Count Thurn repelled
an attack of the Imperialist cavalry, and Anhalt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
followed up this success by advancing in his turn.
But Tilly came to the rescue, drove back Anhalt’s
forces, and stormed the fortifications which had just
been erected. Then a complete panic seized the
Protestant army; the soldiers fled in confusion, and
many were drowned in the Moldau in their endeavour
to escape from the Imperialists. Anhalt did his best
to rally the fugitives; but he soon found that further
resistance was hopeless. Tschernembl, indeed, still
wished to defend Prague, and even to organise a new
attack; but the rest of the Council decided to open
negotiations with Ferdinand. It was resolved, however,
that the Queen and her child should at once be
sent away into safety; and Frederick went to make
arrangements for this purpose. But, with the departure
of his wife, the wretched King had lost all
remains of hope; and, no sooner had he despatched
her on her journey, than he suddenly mounted his horse
and galloped off after her, followed by Ruppa and
other members of the Provisional Government. Count
Thurn’s son endeavoured, indeed, to rally his forces
once more for the defence of the Karlsbrücke; but
the soldiers were too terrified to fight; the Imperialist
army entered the town with little resistance; and on
November 23rd Ferdinand received, at Vienna, a
chest containing the charters of all the Bohemian
privileges.</p>

<p>Of the causes of this final collapse of Bohemian
independence there are three which stand out with
special vividness: the first connected solely with the
events of the insurrection; the second, with the condition
of Bohemia ever since the fall of Tabor; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
third, with a fatal weakness that had reappeared continually
through the greater part of Bohemian history.
The first was the character of the leaders who undertook
to guide this movement. With the exception
of Budovĕc and Tschernembl there seem to be none
of those heroic figures at the helm of affairs which
are indispensable for a struggle for independence; and,
of these two exceptions, Budovĕc had been speedily
thrust into the background by his more ambitious
colleagues, and Tschernembl’s advice was disregarded
in most vital points. Of the rest, Ruppa seems to
have been cowardly and colourless; Count Thurn,
rash and unscrupulous to the last degree; Christian
of Anhalt, an ambitious self-seeker; Mansfeld, a mere
soldier of fortune, with rather less principle than
Dugald Dalgetty; and as for the Elector Palatine,
the story has shown how deficient he was in every
kingly quality.</p>

<p>The second cause of weakness was the fatally aristocratic
character of the movement. The rejection of
the petitions of the serfs was in only too faithful
harmony with the course of Bohemian history since
the fall of Tabor. The Brotherhood alone had witnessed
for wider sympathies and a higher conception
of humanity and religion; but, as we have seen, even
the Brotherhood had often found it difficult to resist
the encroachment of aristocratic principles on its own
organisation. The cry for freedom for a class could
not animate a nation to resist the enthusiasm of
sincere bigots like Ferdinand of Austria and Maximilian
of Bavaria, nor the military ability of Tilly.</p>

<p>The third error, which hastened the ruin of Bohemia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
was the connection which the Bohemian leaders
had formed with the alien policy and the unsympathetic
schemes of the German intriguers.</p>

<p>From the time when Vratislav received his crown
from Henry IV., to the time when Budovĕc and
Thurn called Christian of Anhalt into their counsels,
this seems to have been the fatal mistake running
through the history of Bohemia. Doubtless both
Vratislav and Vladislav meant well by their country,
and they secured it a more brilliant position for a
time; but they involved that country in many wars
and disputes which hindered its progress, and which
often encouraged unpatriotic intrigues. Doubtless,
too, Wenceslaus and Ottakar promoted the trade
and, for a time, even the freedom of Bohemia, by the
introduction of German laws and German settlers into
their towns; but this innovation, intended by them
as a development of good government in Bohemia,
was easily perverted by Otto of Brandenburg into a
means of new tyranny. Still more unquestionably
well-meant was the attempt of Charles IV. to combine
the greatness of the German Empire with the
growth of culture and learning in Bohemia; but, as
unquestionably, it ended in failure, and its benefit
chiefly consisted in the preparation that it afforded
for the purely Bohemian movement which rose from
its ruins. Hus in the fourteenth century, Peter of
Chelc̆ic and his followers in the fifteenth and sixteenth,
were the people through whom Bohemia was
really able to develop a distinctive life, and thereby
to do most essential service to the other nations of
Europe; and we shall see, from the fragments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
national history which still remain to be told, that it is
through such representatives as these that Bohemia,
even after the loss of its political independence, could
still do some work, which other countries may be the
better for studying.</p>

<h2>XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE BATTLE OF THE WHITE HILL TO THE
PRESENT TIME.</span></h2>

<p>Few crises in the history of a country are so dramatically
complete, or mark so clear a division between
past and future, as the Battle of the White
Hill. Though Mansfeld still held out for a time in
some towns of Bohemia, and though the victories of
Gustavus Adolphus in 1631 led to a temporary return
of the Protestants, such partial checks could not
hinder the establishment of a stifling despotism, nor
remove its traces when established. That Ferdinand
II. desired only to crush rebellion, and to restore the
orthodox Roman Catholic faith, may be true enough;
but he soon found that civil and religious liberty were
bound up together, and that a centralised despotism
at Vienna was the only means of securing that outward
appearance of orthodoxy which is all that the
most energetic despot can produce. The first part
of his efforts was no doubt naturally directed to the
punishment of the insurgents. On the 21st of June,
1621, twenty-seven of the leaders of the insurrection
were executed in the Great Ring of Prague, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
noblest and best of them being old Wenceslaus of
Budova; and many trials, confiscations, and fines
followed, the last of them taking place in 1626.</p>

<p>But Ferdinand soon abandoned the pretext of
repressing insurrection, and proceeded to the great
work of restoring Catholic orthodoxy. At first his
hostility was almost confined to the Protestant
preachers, and his positive schemes were mainly
directed to the exaltation of the Jesuits. Several
preachers had been tortured and killed by the soldiers
in the first heat of victory, and, in 1621, the great
bulk of the Protestant clergy of Prague were ordered
to sell their goods and to migrate to Saxony. Promises
had, indeed, been made to the Elector of Saxony that
the Lutherans should be gently dealt with. Moderate
terms had been offered to the Utraquists, and Tabor
had only surrendered on condition of its liberties
being secured. But all these promises were swept
aside by the eagerness of the Jesuits to recover their
lost ground. They had been expelled and persecuted
during the insurrection, and now their turn was come.
Gradually all schools, books, and newspapers were
placed under their care. The old liberties of Charles
IV.’s University were crushed out, and at last the
University itself was absorbed in a Jesuit college in
which the name of Ferdinand was to be connected
with that of Charles. The censorship of the press
was to be enforced by the careful limitation of the
number of printing-presses, and by the most rigorous
inquiries into faith. Nor was the danger left unmarked
which might arise from the reverence paid to
the Protestant heroes of the past. The statues of Hus
were either destroyed or turned into statues of John
Nepomuc; Z̆iz̆ka’s dust was dug up from his grave
at C̆aslau, and the figure above it was broken to
pieces; a memorial of Rokycana shared the same fate;
while the statue of King George protecting the Cup
was removed from the Teyn Church, and a figure of
the Virgin substituted for it.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that no resistance was
offered to this scheme of persecution. Loc̆ika, the
preacher at the Teyn Church, persisted, even in 1622,
in administering the Cup to the laity. He was rebuked
for this proceeding; but he appealed to his
congregation to stand by him, and he repeated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
offence on the following Sunday. Then soldiers came
into the church to seize him; he escaped by a back
door, and a thousand men gathered to defend his
house. In spite of this defence, however, the soldiers
broke into the house and carried Loc̆ika to prison,
where he soon after died.</p>

<p>More notable still, in its consequences to Bohemia,
was the resistance of Kutna Hora. Even Ferdinand’s
champions and followers had warned him that the
mining industry was of vital importance to the welfare
of Bohemia, and that it could only be maintained by
respecting those powers of self-government which had
been granted for so many centuries to the miners.
But Ferdinand cared little for the material prosperity
of Bohemia. Ever since Z̆iz̆ka had rescued it from
Sigismund, Kutna Hora had remained enthusiastically
Protestant; and it now offered special resistance to
the attempt to Catholicise Bohemia. Ferdinand
resolved at all hazards to crush this opposition. In
defiance of the special liberties of the town he quartered
soldiers upon it; and, when even this did not
crush its spirit, he sent the Jesuits to celebrate Mass
at the church of St. Barbara. Forcible expulsion
seemed at last the only hope for conversion, and, by
the end of 1626, no Protestant was left in Kutna
Hora. Two hundred and eight out of five hundred
and ninety houses were deserted, and the mining
industry was ruined in its chief centre.</p>

<p class="caption">CHURCH OF ST. BARBARA AT KUTNA HORA.</p>

</div>

<p>But there was one Protestant whose claims to consideration
even Ferdinand could not deny. Charles of
Z̆erotin had stood faithfully by the king at the
height of the insurrection, and he had sacrificed position,
and suffered imprisonment, in his cause. Ferdinand
had promised to respect his convictions, and not
to interfere with the Protestants who resided on his
estate. Z̆erotin, therefore, was naturally indignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
when he found the Commissioners of Cardinal Dietrichstein
carrying out, on his lands, their schemes for
the suppression of Protestant worship. He hastened
to Vienna and warmly remonstrated with the Emperor
on his breach of faith. Ferdinand admitted the promises
which he had given, and the services which he
had received from Z̆erotin; but he said that the Pope
was his master in matters of conscience, and the Pope
had forbidden him to keep his promises. Z̆erotin was
not satisfied with this answer. He hastened back to
his own estate, and found that the Commissioners
had just closed a Protestant church and sealed up the
doors. Z̆erotin indignantly tore off the seal, re-opened
the church, and took under his special protection
several of the preachers who had fled from other districts.
A Bohemian nobleman named George Sabovsky
followed Z̆erotin’s example; and thus, both in Bohemia
and Moravia, Protestantism was still kept alive in
certain small districts.</p>

<p>Ferdinand now saw that it was not only the
preachers whom he had to fear; and that to attack
the clergy and destroy the privileges of towns,
while he spared the nobles, was an extremely inadequate
policy. He therefore now issued decrees,
which were partly aimed against the landed proprietors,
partly against Protestants of every class.
In 1624 Protestants were forbidden to register their
lands in that Land Court which alone secured them
a good title to their estates; their children might not
inherit the lands of their fathers unless they deserted
their fathers’ faith; and marriages between Protestants
and Catholics were to be no longer recognised. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
these remedies failed. Z̆erotin still openly defied the
royal Commissioners; and at last, in 1627, all Protestants
were ordered to sell their estates and to leave
the country, under pain of severe punishments.</p>

<p>But, before this climax had been reached, Ferdinand
had discovered how hopelessly entangled with each
other were the principles of civil and of religious liberty.
He had wished merely to Catholicise Bohemia; in
order to effect this, he now found that he must crush
out its national feeling and its constitutional liberties.
The towns had resisted him, therefore the towns must
be deprived of their charters. The Land Court might
evade the decisions against Protestant registration;
the decisions of the Land Court must in future be
overruled by the king. The Estates might make
Protestant laws, and refuse to vote necessary taxes
for his wars; their power must therefore be practically
suppressed; the king must be allowed to re-model
the Constitution, to appoint officials, to raise forces,
and to levy taxes, without interference from any other
authority. Nay, might not Prague rise, again, against
his authority? Therefore the king must carry off the
Bohemian crown to Vienna, and govern Bohemia by
the advice of Austrian councillors. Even in that most
tender point, his language, the Bohemian was to
receive severe wounds. Ferdinand, indeed, had talked
only of equalising the German and Bohemian languages
in the practice of the law courts; but, as
German officials and judges gradually took the place
of Bohemians, and as a German aristocracy rapidly
rose on the ruins of the exiled Bohemian nobles, this
equalisation steadily developed into the exaltation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
German at the expense of Bohemian, while, in the
University and the schools, both these living languages
gave way before the Latin of the Jesuits. The study
of history and physical science almost died out.
Trade steadily decayed, and the population of the
country diminished.</p>

<p>It is obvious that, in such a period as this, the real
history of Bohemia should be rather studied in the
lives of its exiles, than in the dreary records of its
home life. Fortunately, one can find among these
exiles a man who is trebly interesting to the
historian; first, as embodying the highest ideal then
possible to a Bohemian; secondly, as linking together,
in a remarkable manner, the earlier and later stages
of the Bohemian Brotherhood; thirdly, as one of the
founders of the modern methods of education. John
Amos Komensky (better known by his Latin name
of Comenius) was born at Nivnice in Moravia in
1592. His father and mother died early, and the
guardians, to whose care he was left, are said to have
neglected their charge. However, he was sent to the
school of the Brotherhood at Prerov, where he soon
developed a great love of learning; and, at the age
of thirty-two, he was appointed by Charles of Z̆erotin
to the headship of the school in which he had
formerly studied. He soon became impressed with
the unsatisfactory character of the accepted methods
of teaching Latin; and he suggested an easier and
simpler plan. From Prerov he was removed to
Fulnec, the oldest Moravian settlement of the
Brotherhood; but, before he could carry his reforms
any further, he was interrupted in his work by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
Bohemian insurrection. In 1621 a Spanish army
burnt Fulnec; and all Comenius’s books and manuscripts
were destroyed. In the time of persecution
he, like other preachers of the Brotherhood, took
refuge with Charles of Z̆erotin. The sufferings and
uncertainties of his life naturally turned his attention
to theological and moral problems, and his first important
book took the form of an allegory. In this
he describes a journey through scenes of vanity and
confusion, ending in the return to the inner life, and
the realisation of a stronger sympathy with the poor
and suffering.</p>

<p class="caption">JOHN AMOS KOMENSKY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>But the final expulsion of the Protestants from
Bohemia brought Comenius back to the real work
of his life. He and other members of the Brotherhood
now formed a kind of colony at Lissa in
Poland. In that town he resumed his profession of
schoolmaster, and he once more became vividly
conscious of the defects in existing methods of
education. In 1631 he published the book which
embodies his strongest convictions on these matters&mdash;“Janua
aurea reserrata quatuor linguarum.” In
this book he points out that “boys are being
stuffed with the names of things without the things.”
The boy learns to recite by heart a thousand words;
if he does not know how to apply them to things, of
what use will all this provision of words be? Moreover,
the books chosen are too restricted in their character;
and, however excellent in quality, they do not
deal with nearly all the subjects which a boy should
learn. Comenius therefore proposes to arrange sentences
in four languages (Latin, German, French, and
Italian). These sentences deal with a large variety
of subjects, ranging from the creation of the world to
the mechanical arts and the practice of the law-courts;
and they are followed by a vocabulary of the most
necessary words. Comenius, indeed, very generously
admitted that the Jesuits had made a useful beginning
in this matter of the vocabulary; but he did not
consider that their vocabulary was complete enough
for his purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>In a later book called the “Didactica,” he further
explained his principles. The intellect, he urged,
should be developed before mere language is taught.
Language should be learnt from authors, rather than
from grammatical rules. Things should be taught
before organisms; examples before rules. Pictures
should be largely used to bring out the meaning of
the teacher; and children should not be forced to
commit to memory what they do not understand.
The first teaching should be given in the vernacular;
the Latin equivalents should be learnt later. “Nature,”
said Comenius, “cannot be forced, but must be led
willingly. All the senses must be called into play
by the lesson; and the later lessons should be the
natural development of the earlier ones. Whatever
is to be known should be taught. Whatever is
taught should be taught as a present thing of definite
use.”</p>

<p>Comenius had now gained a high reputation in the
Brotherhood; and he was chosen to write the history
of its trials and sufferings. At the same time his
educational works had attracted attention outside his
own circle, and Gustavus Adolphus invited him to
Sweden, to reform the schools in that country. This
invitation Comenius at first refused; but, ten years
later, when his books were in a more advanced condition,
he accepted a proposal, of a somewhat similar
kind, from another country.</p>

<p>Samuel Hartlib, a merchant of London, had been
much interested in the works of Comenius; and, in
his desire to reform English education, he invited the
Bohemian to come over to London. Hartlib had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
shown great liberality to the Bohemian exiles; and
Comenius had already been interested in several
English books. Moreover, one of his own books
had been written at Hartlib’s suggestion, and published,
at Hartlib’s own expense, in London. Comenius,
therefore, decided to accept this invitation, and
he arrived in London in the critical year 1641. The
Long Parliament readily responded to Hartlib’s
proposals; and they voted money for the founding
of three colleges, in which the principles of Comenius
might at once be applied. One of these was to be
at the Savoy, one at Chelsea, and one at Winchester.
Unfortunately, the Irish insurrection turned the
attention of Parliament away from these matters;
and the rapid succession of events, which culminated
in the civil war, convinced the Bohemian that there
was no further possibility, at that time, for the development
of his purposes in England.</p>

<p>But, though Comenius left our country in some
disappointment, it must be remembered that he left
one very eminent disciple behind him. Four years
later, when the hopes of the Puritans had gained
further strength, Hartlib appealed to Milton to
second him in the promotion of his schemes. Milton
turned, somewhat unwillingly, from the composition
of the Areopagitica to the discussion of Hartlib’s
plans; but he was impressed by his friend’s enthusiasm;
and it is evidently of Comenius that he
speaks so warmly in his letter. He there describes
him as “a person sent hither by some good Providence
from a far country, to be the occasion and
incitement of great good to this Island.” Though,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
therefore, the poet had not time “to search out what
many modern Januas and Didactics, more than ever I
shall read, have projected,” he yet consented in this
letter to express his sympathy with the plans of
Comenius and Hartlib. The following words, perhaps,
best sum up his teaching. “If, after some preparatory
grounds of speech, by their certain forms got into
memory, children were led to the praxis thereof, in
some chosen short book lessened thoroughly to them,
they might then learn the substance of good things
and arts in due order, which would bring the whole
language quickly into their power.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Comenius, eager for those spheres
of work, had accepted a second invitation to Sweden,
this time from a Swedish nobleman named De Geer.
The famous Chancellor, Oxenstierna, readily welcomed
the Bohemian to Sweden; though, at the same time,
he complained that previous educational reformers
had pointed out faults without suggesting remedies.
When Comenius produced his schemes, the Chancellor
subjected them to a searching criticism; and,
finding that Comenius was ready to meet his
objections, he consented to place the reform of
Swedish education under his guidance. Comenius,
however, ultimately chose the Prussian town of
Elbing as the centre of his experiments; probably
because he was there nearer to the settlements of
the Brotherhood, and could intervene at times to
mitigate their quarrels or intercede for their rights.</p>

<p>The relation of literary patron to protected man
of genius has never been an easy or a happy one;
and Comenius often found that De Geer complained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
of the slowness of his work, and, still more, perhaps,
of that wide range of sympathies which often distracted
him from the interests to which his patron
desired him to confine himself. Once De Geer even
withdrew his support, for a time, from the needy
Bohemian; and Comenius must have felt this
desertion the more keenly, because his applications
for money had been far oftener made on behalf of
others than for his own needs. But a bitterer blow
awaited him in 1648. He had hoped that the enthusiasm
of Gustavus Adolphus for the Protestant
Cause had been shared by his Councillors, and by his
countrymen generally; and that they would insist
on the restoration of the Protestant Bohemians to
their country, before the final conclusion of the peace.
It was, therefore, a terrible shock to find that Oxenstierna
cared more for the possession of Pomerania
than for the liberties of German or Bohemian Protestants;
and Comenius bitterly reproached the
Swedish Chancellor with his desertion of the cause of
the exiles.</p>

<p>But this year of disappointment brought one consolation.
Comenius was elected Chief Bishop of the
Bohemian Brotherhood; and his exhortations and
encouragements seemed for a time to put new life
into the Society. More noteworthy still is the effect
which these addresses produced in the following
century; for it was they that decided Count Zinzendorf
to welcome the Brethren to Herrnhut, and to
inaugurate that later period of their career during
which they have been known by the name of
“Moravians.” It is interesting, too, to find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
Comenius was actuated by that Slavonic feeling
which was always so powerful in Bohemia; and that
he conceived the idea of translating the Bible into
Turkish, so that, by turning the Sultan to the true
faith, he might secure an easier life for those Slavs
who were suffering under the Mahommedan tyranny.
His educational labours were also carried on with
some effect in Poland and Hungary; and it should
be specially remembered that the German Real-Schule
is as much due to the inspiration of Comenius
as the Universities of Leipzic and Wittenberg are to
the model provided for them, and the scholars trained
in the University of Prague.</p>

<p>But, though the career of Comenius shows that
there were still Bohemians who tried to keep alive
the intellectual and moral life of their nation, such
instances are but rare interruptions to the dreary
record of stifling tyranny which stretched over the
last years during which the male line of the Hapsburgs
governed Bohemia. Doubtless, occasionally,
energetic students, like the Jesuits, Balbin and Pes̆ina,
give hopes of an ultimate revival of interest in the
national history; sometimes an insurrection of the
peasantry, like that of 1680, seems to hint that
tyranny may become intolerable at last. Joseph I.,
indeed, is credited with a desire for reform; but at
any rate there is no sign of a realisation of his ideas;
and it is only when the male Hapsburgs make way
for the one female ruler of their race that a day of better
things seems just about to dawn. Even that dawn
was very slow in breaking. Some encouragement
was given to culture by Maria Theresa, and a literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
society was founded; but it soon became apparent
that even literary discussions involved an awkward
revival of the past; and the censors again interfered
to check intellectual progress. The Empress-Queen
relaxed the feudal oppression of the peasantry; but
only enough was granted to excite, without satisfying,
the desire for liberty. One step, however, was gained
during this reign, which cleared the ground for future
progress. Popes and kings at last realised that that
great Order, before which they had bowed, might
become as dangerous to them as to the people whom
they governed; and, in 1773, Clement XIV. dissolved
the Society of Jesus. This dissolution struck a blow
at that monopoly of education which had stunted the
intellectual life of Bohemia, and it prepared the way
for the changes of the following reign.</p>

<p>In 1780, Joseph II. of Germany, the first king of
the House of Lorraine, succeeded his mother as ruler
of all the dominions of the House of Austria. He at
once signalised his accession to power by an Edict of
Toleration, which allowed all Protestants to return to
Bohemia, and to settle there freely. But, with all his
zeal for enlightenment, Joseph was hampered by
those old traditions of uniformity which he had
received from his mother’s family. He soon found
that Protestants could not be all rolled together in
compact bundles and kept quiet there. Not only the
Bohemian Brothers, but a number of very strange
sects, would come in under the new Edict. Some of
these did not even profess Christianity; and Joseph
was yet more irritated to find that men who had
special convictions sometimes wished to express them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
in ways of which their neighbours disapproved. The
Protestants were therefore called upon to accept
either the Augsburg Confession or the Calvinistic
Formulæ; and, when he at last realised that there
was a growing body in the country who refused to
accept any definite Christian creed, Joseph’s feelings
of toleration gave way. Children were torn from
their parents to be educated in sounder principles,
and the parents were banished to Transylvania.</p>

<p>A blot, that created even more general indignation
in Bohemia, stained Joseph’s schemes of educational
reform. Here, too, he wished to remove restrictions
and to extend knowledge; but here again the Hapsburg
instinct was too strong for eighteenth-century
enlightenment. The Latin of the Jesuits was, indeed,
to be deposed from its supremacy. Printing-presses
were to be established. Studies previously rejected
were to be encouraged. But the tyranny of Latin
only made way for the tyranny of German. <i>That</i>
was to be the one recognised language of education;
and Bohemian was to yield to it even more completely
than it had yielded to the language of an older
civilisation.</p>

<p>Nor had Parliaments or municipalities any chance
of life. No laws were to be passed by the Bohemian
Estates without the sanction of an Austrian Board;
the censorship of Bohemian books was to be conducted
from Vienna; a brand-new municipal code
was to check the free play of the old Town Rights.
Only in one matter was freedom to be unhampered
in its progress, and untainted by any of those inconsistent
arrangements which took back with one hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
what the other hand had given. The power of the
lord over the serf was to be completely broken; and
the freed peasants might move as they pleased from
place to place, and might choose whatever trade or
study they desired, unhampered by the authority of
their former masters.</p>

<p>But the opposition to the denationalising plans of
Joseph, which assumed so violent a form in Hungary
and the Netherlands, encouraged the Bohemians also
to protest in a milder fashion; and, when Leopold
succeeded Joseph as King of Bohemia, he was forced
to reconsider his brother’s policy, to convoke the
Bohemian Assembly once more, and to make concessions
to the national feeling in the matter of language.
For, in spite of all repressions and discouragements,
that feeling had never ceased to have its influence in
Bohemia; and it was well illustrated by three men of
very different type, who had begun their efforts in the
discouraging times of repression, and who lived on
into more hopeful days.</p>

<p>Of these the eldest was Frantis̆ek Pelc̆el, who was
born at Rychnov (Reichenau) in 1735. He was a man
of obscure birth, and he was intended by his parents
for the medical profession. But he did not like this
occupation; so he went to Prague to study in the
High School, where he partly supported himself by
teaching the children of rich citizens. Finding, however,
that logic was better taught at Králové Dvůr
(Königinhof), he went there to study; but, while he
was there, the school was placed more completely
under Jesuit control. The strange mixture of repulsion
and attraction which that wonderful Society seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
generally to excite in its pupils, had its influence over
Pelc̆el; and the attraction proving, for the time, the
stronger feeling, he was inclined to give himself to
theology; but the Seven Years War cut short his
studies, and he left Bohemia for Vienna.</p>

<p>It was on his return to Prague that he fell in with
the second of the men who were to be the great
promoters of the new movement. This was Count
Caspar of Sternberg, the son of an officer who had
served under Maria Theresa. He, like Pelc̆el, had
been attracted to the study of theology; but his
audacious speculations had startled the professors at
the German College in Rome, and the Jesuits had
produced on him a purely repellent effect. After the
dissolution of the German College, Sternberg had
returned to Prague, and had given himself to the
study of art. He soon took notice of Pelc̆el, and
entrusted to him the education of his children. This
turned Pelc̆el from his theological speculations; but
it was not till his transfer to the family of another
nobleman that he devoted himself wholly to the
study and writing of history. His life of Charles IV.
and his short history of Bohemia may be wanting in
the wide views and deeper insight of later historians;
but the evidence of enormous industry and hearty
interest in the subject make a distinct mark in the
progress of national feeling.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of the leaders of the movement,
and the one who seems to be the most looked
back to by the historians of the present day, was
Josef Dobrovsky. He, too, was intended by his
Jesuit teachers for a theological career; and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
only the suppression of that Order which turned him
for a time to the study of the language. He did not,
however, abandon theology. In 1778 he brought out
a commentary on Bohemian literature; and in 1779
he began to edit a journal in which contemporary
Bohemian literature was noticed and criticised.
Curiously enough, his conclusions about Bohemian
history were rather opposed to those of modern
national historians. He threw doubts on the existence
of the common Slavonic language; and he rather
discredited the extent of the influence of Cyril and
Methodius, as compared with that of the Roman
Church. But for the Bohemian language he was
keenly zealous, and when, in 1790, Leopold appeared
at a meeting of the Bohemian Society of Sciences,
Dobrovsky appealed to him to protect his countrymen
in the use of their mother-tongue. The Emperor
was so much impressed by this appeal, that he
sent six thousand gulden to the society, for the
promotion of journeys for inquiry into the Bohemian
history and language. Dobrovsky was chosen to
travel in Sweden and Russia, both for the recovery of
lost manuscripts and for the collection of further
information about Slavonic literature.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Count Caspar von Sternberg had
been forced to abandon official life, and had begun to
devote himself more exclusively to the promotion of
art, literature, and science. The Emperor Francis
showed himself almost as friendly as Leopold had
been to the revival of Bohemian literature and art;
and, in 1818, he assented to the foundation of the
National Museum at Prague for the collection of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
kinds of literary, artistic, and scientific antiquities of
Bohemia. The foundation of this museum was
almost contemporaneous with events which excited,
to the highest pitch, the champions of Bohemian
language and literature.</p>

<p>A man named Hanka, in hunting for some ecclesiastical
documents in the vault of the church of
Králové Dvůr, found an old chest in the wall, in which
church ornaments were kept. Hidden behind this
were some curious old manuscripts, which, on examination,
proved to be Bohemian songs of a comparatively
early date. They were at once despatched
to Prague, and were handed over by Count Sternberg
to two men who were now gaining much reputation.
These were Josef S̆afarik, a Slovak from that district
of Hungary where a dialect of the Bohemian language
is usually spoken, and Frantis̆ek Palacký, the son of
a Calvinist minister, who had been marked out for an
important post in the new museum. They examined
the manuscript, and, after long consideration, pronounced
it genuine. This discovery seemed to open
a new world of life and thought to the champions of
national literature. Most of the songs, it was true,
dealt mainly with battles; but the power of expression
seemed to indicate a condition of culture in the
ninth or tenth century which led the Bohemians to
believe in an early development of national life,
uninfluenced by Teutonic intruders.</p>

<p>Count Sternberg now issued an appeal to the
possessors of all antiquities, whether literary, artistic,
or scientific, to send them to the National Museum.
One of the first answers to this appeal was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
anonymous letter, in which
the writer announced
that he had discovered
another Bohemian manuscript
in a certain castle;
but that he feared to give
his name or call public
attention to the place, as
the owner of the castle
was a German “Michel”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
who would destroy any
Bohemian manuscript if
he found it. The writer,
therefore, forwarded the
manuscript secretly, without
waiting for the lord’s
permission. The manuscript
was found to be
the poem of the Libus̆in
Saud described in the first
chapter of this history;
and the writer, on inquiry,
was discovered to be
Kovar, the bailiff of Count
Colloredo-Mansfeld. The
manuscript, it appeared,
had been discovered in
a vault of the Castle of
Zelená hora (Grünberg),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
in Nepomuc, where the bailiff had been examining
a number of business papers. This manuscript was
also examined, and was pronounced by Palacký and
S̆afarik to be of earlier date than the Königinhof
manuscript.</p>

<p>These discoveries, however, were not suffered to
pass unchallenged. At first, indeed, the controversy
seemed likely to be conducted on scientific principles.
The chief opponent of their authenticity was the
zealous patriot Dobrovsky; and he disputed their
claim to historic worth on philological grounds. But
soon the controversy passed out of the serene air of
scientific discussion. The eager enthusiasm with
which most Bohemian patriots had hailed the discovery
of the manuscripts, aroused an equally eager
desire on the part of the enemies of their language to
dispute the authenticity of these discoveries; and
savage German critics accused Hanka and Kovar of
forgery, and denounced as absurd the suggestion of
any possible Bohemian civilisation which had not
come from Germany. The writings of S̆afarik on the
various Slavonic languages kept the discussion alive;
and the appearance, in 1836, of the early volumes of
Palacký’s history roused still angrier attacks.</p>

</div>

<p>Even before this literary revival had taken place,
discoveries had been made which seemed to point to
an early culture even amongst the Bohemian peasantry.
Bronzes and earthenware ornaments had
been dug up, the antiquity of which was proved by
the heathen symbols marked upon them; and it was
noticed that these devices corresponded to the designs
which were produced in later ages by the peasantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
in Bohemia and Moravia. This curious fact gave a
new impulse to investigation, and numerous specimens
of the peasant art were collected. The beauty of
colouring and design in this work is the more striking
because it was not learnt in any school, but is the
fruit of native genius. About the same time a similar
interest was roused in the music produced by the
peasantry, and the songs and dances of the peasants
have been embodied in the operas of S̆metana.</p>

<p>The revolution of 1848 naturally brought to a head
the struggle between the Germans and Bohemians:
and the demand then made for the further protection
of the Bohemian language was strengthened at a later
stage by the meeting of the Slavonic Congress, which
was to protect the Slavs against the threatened
encroachment of the Frankfort Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The
unfortunate rising of June, 1848, led to the downfall
of the newly-born liberty of Bohemia; but, when
German and Magyar revolutions were alike crushed,
questions of race-division naturally ceased for a time
to be interesting to those who had suffered a common
loss of liberty. The idea of a federative union of
the Austrian dominions was, however, kept steadily
before the public by Palacký; and the old fear of
sinking to an equality with other races gradually
roused the Germans to renewed action. In 1858 the
controversy about the manuscripts of Králové Dvůr
and Zelená hora was renewed in all its fierceness; and
when, after the Austrian collapse in 1859, the talk
about Constitutional government once more began,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
it was soon found that the new liberties were not to
produce equality of race. The wars of 1866 and
1870 gave a new impulse to the German claim for
supremacy in Austria; and so the struggle has gone
on with varying fortune, but ever circling round the
central point of language and literature.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The following account of the legend of Libus̆a is taken partly
from the translation of the Libus̆in Saud by Mr. A. H. Wratislaw,
partly from the version of the story given by Cosmas. I have not
the least desire to enter here into the burning question of the
authenticity of the original poem. I have heard every degree and
variety of opinion on that subject, even from patriotic Bohemians.
But the only two points that concern me here are, first, that Cosmas
must have had before him some old legend containing a version of
the story, not unlike that edited and translated by Mr. Wratislaw;
secondly, that Cosmas accepted this story as embodying his conception
of the beginnings of Bohemian history. No one, as far as I
know, disputes the genuineness of Cosmas’s history; into the sources
of his information it is not necessary to go.</p>

This word is <i>Kostel</i>, which is obviously formed from the German

marked by the use of castles as churches.</p>
